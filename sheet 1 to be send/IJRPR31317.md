3.5 Measurements and Results 
Circularly Polarized Antenna obtained a full wave simulated aperture efficiency higher than 75% and a relative bandwidth of over 44% relative bandwidth, 
and an axial ratio lower than 3 dB with over 35% relative bandwidth. The circularly polarized lens reached more than 30 dB of gain with only 0.65 dB 
dielectric loss. The measured resulting gain of the design is 34 dB while its total bandwidth was not indicated. These results illustrate the antenna's 
capability to generate multiple directives circularly polarized beams while effectively maintaining the axial ratio bandwidth. 
In WHEMS (Wideband, High-Efficiency Electromagnetic Structure), the antenna achieved a gain bandwidth of 22%, corresponding to 0.011 THz (or 11 
GHz), spanning from 0.06 THz to 0.075 THz. Within this frequency band, the antenna demonstrated a relative gain of 8-10 dBi. The radiation aperture 
used in this study was 4.7 × 4.7 mm² (equivalent to 1 × 1 elements). 
The Grid Array Antenna has an impedance bandwidth spanning from 0.136 THz to 0.157 THz (equivalent to 136 GHz to 157 GHz). The antenna achieved 
a maximum gain of 14.5 dBi at 0.146 THz and exhibited vertical beams in the broadside direction within the frequency range of 0.141 THz to 0.149 THz. 
The Circularly Polarized Conical Horn Antenna was designed for operation in the frequency range of 0.27 THz to 0.33 THz, providing a bandwidth of 
60 GHz. The antenna achieved a measured directivity of 18.3 dBic at the broadside direction specifically at 0.312 THz. The results demonstrated that the 
measured normalized radiation patterns closely matched the simulated results across different frequencies in both the elevation and azimuth planes, 
particularly at the broadside direction with good symmetry in both planes. The antenna design utilized an all-metal structure fabricated using Wire-EDM 
(Wire Electrical Discharge Machining) technology, showcasing high precision in the manufacturing of its components. 
Circularly Polarized Lens antenna was developed to achieve right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) radiation using an LF (Low Frequency) feed source. 
The antenna obtained a gain of 30.8 dBic at 0.3 THz. The measured 1-dB gain bandwidth and 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of the THz CP lens 
reached 13.3% and 18.8%, 
The Quasi Yagi–Uda antenna design with a Q-factor of 573 at 0.482 THz. To address return loss issues in harmonics and enhance the antenna bandwidth 
to 15.2%, a THz filter employing graphene load was introduced between the power divider and the array antenna. The suggested total gain of the antenna 
was 9.07 dB, featuring a directive pattern and a side-lobe level of -5 db. The results of this design demonstrated a wider bandwidth covering 0.45 to 0.5 
THz, with a gain of 9 db. 
The design of Patch Antenna and Antenna Array focused on a wide-band cavity-backed aperture-coupled patch antenna and a 16- element antenna array 
on a multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) for D-band applications. The insertion loss was measured at 1.9 dB/cm for the microstrip line and 1.8 dB/cm 
for the coplanar waveguide at 0.15 THz. The study results indicated that the maximum gain for a single antenna was 7 dBi, and for the 16-element array, 
it was 14 dBi, both achieved at 0.143 THz. The measured antenna input matching bandwidth was 0.02 THz. The presented D-band antennas and PCB 
substrate technology demonstrated good performance and enabled the integration of complex MMICs (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits) and 
antennas into scalable phased antenna arrays. 
Transmit array, all-dielectric Huygens' transmit array, was proposed and demonstrated in the 0.12 THz band. The results of the study revealed that the 
design caused a maximum decrease in gain of approximately 2 db. The frequency range covered by this design was from 0.12 THz to 0.13 THz, achieving 
a gain ranging between 32 dB to 34 db. 
The Vivaldi antennas designed achieved a simulated gain of -10 dB and an impedance bandwidth of approximately 0.076 THz, with a minimum return 
loss of - 58.83 db. The peak gain reached 11.77 dB, and the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) was 1.002. Additionally, the radiation efficiency was 
measured at 97.4%, and the directivity was 11.89 dBi at a resonant frequency of 0.603 THz. To validate the design method, the antennas were tested at 
frequencies of 0.06125 THz and 0.06215 THz. 
The antenna SRR Slotted Waveguide Array exhibits a 10 dB impedance bandwidth spanning 0.088 THz, specifically from 0.244 THz to 0.332 THz, 
covering the WM864 band with a maximum gain of 15.3 dBi. This design also features a broad 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 0.03571 THz, ranging 
from 0.25172 THz to 0.28751 THz. The study's F. A. Author et al. 2 VOL. XX, NO. XX, MONTH 20XX results demonstrate that this SRR (Split Ring 
Resonator) Slotted Waveguide Array achieved a gain of 15.2 dBi and a resulting bandwidth of 88 GHz, a 35 GHz range within the 3 dB AR bandwidth, 
and a radiation efficiency of 94%.

The design presented in Resonant Cavity Antenna yielded two sets of results: one from simulation and the other from fabrication. In simulation, the 
antenna was modeled with a size of 2.4 × 2.4 mm, operating in the H-band, using a 3DP fabrication technique, achieving a 9.9% bandwidth for 3 dB gain, 
and a peak gain of 16.2 db. Upon actual 3D printing fabrication, the antenna size increased to 24 × 24 mm, with the working band shifting to Ka-band, 
maintaining a 10% bandwidth for 3 dB gain, and achieving a peak gain of 16 db. 
Finally, findings in Offset Cassegrain antenna indicated that the reflection coefficient of the Sub-THz offset Cassegrain antenna is -19 dB across a 
bandwidth of 0.22-0.31 THz. The antenna achieved a half-power beamwidth ranging from 0.7° to 0.8°, with the worst-case sidelobe level below - 24 db. 
The maximum measured gain was 48 dBi.

3.3 Antenna Design 
The papers that were included in this review mainly focus on the various antenna designs that are suitable for 6G Applications. In order to achieve high 
performance metrics, an antenna design with a broadband G-band lens integrated with a dielectric grid polarizer has been developed by (Campo et al., 
2021). The design was intended to achieve a full wave simulated aperture efficiency of more than 75% and an axial ratio of less than 3dB over the relative 
bandwidth of 35%. The primary objective of the paper was to optimize the feed-polarizer-lens system efficiently using a quasi-analytical model based on 
a multi-layer Spectral Green’s Function (SGF) approach. In order to analyze the lens, the study used a quasi-analytical approach to estimate the circular 
polarized (CP) aperture efficiency and the axial ratio of the lens after implantation. The frequency range of the antenna was limited to 180 GHz. The 
polarizer was manufactured with a dielectric constant of Ꜫr =2.3 in the form of Topas material, chosen for its hardness, which facilitates the milling 
process. An HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) lens was placed on top of the polarizer due to its extremely low loss properties tan δ =3.4 x10-4 (Campo 
et al., 2019). 
(Chi et al., 2020) introduces a PCB-based antenna design featuring a grounded, wideband, high-efficiency electromagnetic structure (WHEMS) with a 
backing cavity and a radiating choke. As shown in previous research, this antenna configuration is widely used for low frequencies applications because 
of its balance structure, large bandwidth and great gain characteristics (Cai et al., 2018; Chi, Qi, Weng, Yu, Li, et al., 2019; Chi, Qi, Weng, Yu, & Zhuang, 
2019; Xiao et al., 2018). The antenna is constructed on two layers of printed circuit board, according to this design. The metal wall (MW) of the antenna 
can be constructed using either grounded vias (GV) or connected grounded vias (CGV). The substrates S1 and S2 have thicknesses of 0.765 mm and 
0.508 mm, respectively, and are realized using Rogers 3003 material with a dielectric constant of 3.0.  
(B. Zhang et al., 2016) focuses on creating an antenna on liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and design it for the D-band antenna-in-package applications. 
They have chosen to use LCP technology for the purpose of creating an antenna that provides stable performance, low material costs and a large processing 
area. But its low laminating temperature, as well as its inherent softness, are drawbacks of the LCP. This means that in order to form a bond, the LCP 
needs relatively little heat and may have some limitations where it is necessary to use warmer temperatures. The paper reports that Saiz et al. have used 
an LCP material, which has been reported not to be able to maximize the increase in gain due to the length of the LCP rod (Saiz et al., 2014). Therefore, 
it is necessary to consider that the heat stability of an LCP device is due to its effect being based on an environment temperature, as this material is cost 
efficient and offers large processing areas.  
A circularly polarized conical horn antenna operating at 0.3 THz (300 GHz) for 6G wireless applications was proposed in (Aqlan et al., 2020). The study 
utilized Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM). The antenna structure is composed of a waveguide feed, circular polarizer disk, and a conical horn. 
The proposed antenna structure consists of waveguide feed, circular polarizer disk, and a conical horn. The circular polarizer disk is a crossed-slot antenna 
with unequal sub-wavelength lengths of Ls1 = 0.51 mm, Ls2 = 0.46 mm, and a width of Ws = 0.1 mm, with a thickness of 0.1 mm. The dimensions of 
for the radius of horn throat is ai = 0.4 mm, the radius of horn aperture a0 = 1.9 mm, and the conical horn axial length L = 4 mm.  
A study was conducted by (Wu et al., 2019) on a lens antenna that is circularly polarized (CP) and has high gain. The antenna is fed by a pyramidal horn 
that is linearly polarized (LP) and operates at 0.3 THz. The paper chose a lens antenna due to its high-gain applications in the THz range. This design has 
the advantage of avoiding the high loss of the feeding network in fed arrays due to its space feeding nature. The frequency range of operation for this 
design is between 0.24-0.32 THz. 
A novel substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) Quasi Yagi-Uda antenna was suggested to demonstrate the impact of PBG and SIW formation on the gain 
and Q-factor of this antenna type. These parameters are crucial in various applications related to 6G satellite communication. The research also analyzed 
the influence of the graphene layer on the return loss of the transmission line (Tabatabaeian, 2021).  
An antenna design was proposed by (Lamminen et al., 2020) that utilized a 16-element antenna array along with a wide-band cavity-backed aperture-
coupled patch antenna. The aim of this design was to target D-band applications. In this study, the transmission lines used to investigate the possible 
losses at the D-band were microstrip line and grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW). The antenna array was intended to operate within a frequency 
range of 135-155 GHz or 0.135- 0.155 THz. The final PCB used in this design had a total thickness of 373µm, which included the plated copper layers. 
The substrate material chosen for this design was Megtron 7N (εr = 3.20, tan
 = 0.003 at 50 GHz) produced by Panasonic, which was selected for its 
dielectric properties, dielectric thickness availability, and ease of processing. For patterning the PCB, traditional methods were used along with 
photolithography to determine the areas where the copper should be retained, whereas those that are unimaged will be etched away (Gantz, n.d.). A 
parametric analysis of the proposed patch antenna was performed by changing the main design parameters lp & wp, lap, and lst. 
Following this, (Emara et al., 2020) proposed an all-dielectric Huygens’ transmit array which was demonstrated in the 120 GHz band. In order to quantify 
the effect on antenna VOL. XX, NO. XX, MONTH 20XX 5 gain and estimate the tolerance of a uniform array, this paper has used laser drilling 
technology. This paper also presented a brief comparison of the related antenna design. 
In reference (Kushwaha & Karuppanan, 2019), the design and analysis of Vivaldi antennas for millimeter and terahertz (THz) band applications were 
presented. The antennas were tested within the frequency range of 0.06125 THz to 0.06215 THz. The study involved optimizing dimensions, including 
parameters such as ANT-1 (µm), ANT-2 (µm), ANT-3 (mm), ANT-4 (mm), ANT-1 (µm²), ANT-2 (µm²), ANT-3 (mm²), and ANT-4 (mm²), for different 
aspects of the proposed Vivaldi antennas. Furthermore, the paper conducted analyses of four different Vivaldi antenna structures within the frequency 
range of 0.06 THz to 0.065 THz, as well as in the millimeter-wave frequency band ranging from 0.56 THz to 0.74 THz.  

International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 5, no 7, pp 911-920 July 2024                                     915 
 
 
(Ansha et al., 2021) utilized an antenna design featuring a split ring resonator (SRR) slotted waveguide array was proposed. This antenna demonstrated 
a 10 dB impedance bandwidth spanning 88 GHz, ranging from 0.244 THz to 0.332 THz. Additionally, an axial ratio bandwidth of 35.71 GHz, covering 
frequencies from 0.25172 THz to 0.28751 THz, was achieved. The study included investigations into parametric variations of slot width and split gap, 
analyzing their effects on return loss and gain characteristics of the antenna. This research highlights the importance of optimizing slot geometry and split 
configurations to achieve desired performance metrics in terms of impedance bandwidth and axial ratio over a wide frequency range in the terahertz 
spectrum.  
The referenced paper by (Xu et al., 2020) provides a comprehensive review of antennas showcasing advancements in wideband and high-gain sub-
millimeter wave and low-THz frequencies. It presents a comparative analysis of the performance of these antennas. Additionally, the paper explores an 
all-metal model inspired by Fabry-Perot cavity (FPC) theory and its application in THz communications. A notable contribution of the study is the 
development of a wideband, high-gain resonant cavity antenna (RCA) designed to operate at 300 GHz. Despite being fabricated at a size ten times larger 
than the operational frequency (30 GHz), the antenna was successfully produced using metal binder jetting technology, a form of 3D printing.  
Lastly, (Kosogor & Tikhov, 2020) design a Sub-THz offset Cassegrain antenna for multi-Gbps applications. The antenna was demonstrated within the 
frequency range of 0.22-0.3 THz (220-300 GHz). The primary objective of the study was to assess the feasibility of employing an offset dual-reflector 
configuration to achieve high gain and wideband characteristics for sub-THz point-to-point radio communication. The antenna design featured a conical 
horn feed combined with a rectangular waveguide section incorporating a smooth E-plane bend of 35.6°. The antenna was configured for linear (vertical) 
polarization. Additionally, the weight of the antenna was specified at 640 grams.  
Table 1 shows the 12 publications reviewed in this paper where the antenna types, frequency range, material used for the antenna design, its fabrication 
technology, and its results were summarized.

2. Methodology 
2.1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
The primary criterion for material selection is subject relevance, emphasizing research investigating antenna design approaches, algorithms, and 
technologies for 6G applications. This criterion assures that the chosen literature is relevant to the study goal and contributes to our understanding of 
advanced antenna design approaches for 6G applications. Respectable publication platforms, such as IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, 
SpringerLink, Wiley Online Library, IET Digital Library, Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, and MDPI, are prioritized during the selection 
process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. Temporal considerations are also important, with a preference for papers within the 
last eight years that reflect the most recent innovations and breakthroughs in antenna design technology for 6G applications. This guarantees that the 
literature evaluation is current and appropriately reflects the status of research on this fast-growing topic. However, studies, publications, and papers not 
directly linked to antenna design for 6G applications are removed. This covers research into earlier generations (such as 4G or 5G), other antennas that 
do not apply to 6G and other features of 6G that do not include antenna design. Publications from platforms that lack solid peer-review processes or have 
a reputation for providing incorrect information are also prohibited. Only older articles that reflect the most recent state of antenna design for 6G 
applications are included if they contain valuable historical or foundational knowledge. This guarantees that the literature review is accurate and reliable. 
Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications 
The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter 
them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please 
do not revise any of the current designations. 
2.2 Literature Search Strategy and Databases Used 
In April 2024, an elaborate inquiry with the primary objective of exploring next-generation antenna designs, specifically focusing on antenna design for 
6G applications. The study began with the phrase "antenna design for 6G applications." Figure 1 depicts the strategy and results, indicating the systematic 
advancement of the search process. 
 
Fig. 1 - Flowchart of the Publication Selection Process. 

International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 5, no 7, pp 911-920 July 2024                                     913 
 
 
The search produced many results from several databases, demonstrating the breadth of knowledge on the subject. The IEEE Xplore website yielded 140 
results; Google Scholar 17,500, ScienceDirect 743, SpringerLink 506; Wiley Online Library 5,855; IET Digital Library 56, Foundations and Trends in 
Machine Learning an impressive 187,977; and MDPI 196. A second step was taken to refine the search and focus on open-access publications, yielding

3.3 Antenna Design 
The papers that were included in this review mainly focus on the various antenna designs that are suitable for 6G Applications. In order to achieve high 
performance metrics, an antenna design with a broadband G-band lens integrated with a dielectric grid polarizer has been developed by (Campo et al., 
2021). The design was intended to achieve a full wave simulated aperture efficiency of more than 75% and an axial ratio of less than 3dB over the relative 
bandwidth of 35%. The primary objective of the paper was to optimize the feed-polarizer-lens system efficiently using a quasi-analytical model based on 
a multi-layer Spectral Green’s Function (SGF) approach. In order to analyze the lens, the study used a quasi-analytical approach to estimate the circular 
polarized (CP) aperture efficiency and the axial ratio of the lens after implantation. The frequency range of the antenna was limited to 180 GHz. The 
polarizer was manufactured with a dielectric constant of Ꜫr =2.3 in the form of Topas material, chosen for its hardness, which facilitates the milling 
process. An HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) lens was placed on top of the polarizer due to its extremely low loss properties tan δ =3.4 x10-4 (Campo 
et al., 2019). 
(Chi et al., 2020) introduces a PCB-based antenna design featuring a grounded, wideband, high-efficiency electromagnetic structure (WHEMS) with a 
backing cavity and a radiating choke. As shown in previous research, this antenna configuration is widely used for low frequencies applications because 
of its balance structure, large bandwidth and great gain characteristics (Cai et al., 2018; Chi, Qi, Weng, Yu, Li, et al., 2019; Chi, Qi, Weng, Yu, & Zhuang, 
2019; Xiao et al., 2018). The antenna is constructed on two layers of printed circuit board, according to this design. The metal wall (MW) of the antenna 
can be constructed using either grounded vias (GV) or connected grounded vias (CGV). The substrates S1 and S2 have thicknesses of 0.765 mm and 
0.508 mm, respectively, and are realized using Rogers 3003 material with a dielectric constant of 3.0.  
(B. Zhang et al., 2016) focuses on creating an antenna on liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and design it for the D-band antenna-in-package applications. 
They have chosen to use LCP technology for the purpose of creating an antenna that provides stable performance, low material costs and a large processing 
area. But its low laminating temperature, as well as its inherent softness, are drawbacks of the LCP. This means that in order to form a bond, the LCP 
needs relatively little heat and may have some limitations where it is necessary to use warmer temperatures. The paper reports that Saiz et al. have used 
an LCP material, which has been reported not to be able to maximize the increase in gain due to the length of the LCP rod (Saiz et al., 2014). Therefore, 
it is necessary to consider that the heat stability of an LCP device is due to its effect being based on an environment temperature, as this material is cost 
efficient and offers large processing areas.  
A circularly polarized conical horn antenna operating at 0.3 THz (300 GHz) for 6G wireless applications was proposed in (Aqlan et al., 2020). The study 
utilized Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM). The antenna structure is composed of a waveguide feed, circular polarizer disk, and a conical horn. 
The proposed antenna structure consists of waveguide feed, circular polarizer disk, and a conical horn. The circular polarizer disk is a crossed-slot antenna 
with unequal sub-wavelength lengths of Ls1 = 0.51 mm, Ls2 = 0.46 mm, and a width of Ws = 0.1 mm, with a thickness of 0.1 mm. The dimensions of 
for the radius of horn throat is ai = 0.4 mm, the radius of horn aperture a0 = 1.9 mm, and the conical horn axial length L = 4 mm.  
A study was conducted by (Wu et al., 2019) on a lens antenna that is circularly polarized (CP) and has high gain. The antenna is fed by a pyramidal horn 
that is linearly polarized (LP) and operates at 0.3 THz. The paper chose a lens antenna due to its high-gain applications in the THz range. This design has 
the advantage of avoiding the high loss of the feeding network in fed arrays due to its space feeding nature. The frequency range of operation for this 
design is between 0.24-0.32 THz. 
A novel substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) Quasi Yagi-Uda antenna was suggested to demonstrate the impact of PBG and SIW formation on the gain 
and Q-factor of this antenna type. These parameters are crucial in various applications related to 6G satellite communication. The research also analyzed 
the influence of the graphene layer on the return loss of the transmission line (Tabatabaeian, 2021).  
An antenna design was proposed by (Lamminen et al., 2020) that utilized a 16-element antenna array along with a wide-band cavity-backed aperture-
coupled patch antenna. The aim of this design was to target D-band applications. In this study, the transmission lines used to investigate the possible 
losses at the D-band were microstrip line and grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW). The antenna array was intended to operate within a frequency 
range of 135-155 GHz or 0.135- 0.155 THz. The final PCB used in this design had a total thickness of 373µm, which included the plated copper layers. 
The substrate material chosen for this design was Megtron 7N (εr = 3.20, tan
 = 0.003 at 50 GHz) produced by Panasonic, which was selected for its 
dielectric properties, dielectric thickness availability, and ease of processing. For patterning the PCB, traditional methods were used along with 
photolithography to determine the areas where the copper should be retained, whereas those that are unimaged will be etched away (Gantz, n.d.). A 
parametric analysis of the proposed patch antenna was performed by changing the main design parameters lp & wp, lap, and lst. 
Following this, (Emara et al., 2020) proposed an all-dielectric Huygens’ transmit array which was demonstrated in the 120 GHz band. In order to quantify 
the effect on antenna VOL. XX, NO. XX, MONTH 20XX 5 gain and estimate the tolerance of a uniform array, this paper has used laser drilling 
technology. This paper also presented a brief comparison of the related antenna design. 
In reference (Kushwaha & Karuppanan, 2019), the design and analysis of Vivaldi antennas for millimeter and terahertz (THz) band applications were 
presented. The antennas were tested within the frequency range of 0.06125 THz to 0.06215 THz. The study involved optimizing dimensions, including 
parameters such as ANT-1 (µm), ANT-2 (µm), ANT-3 (mm), ANT-4 (mm), ANT-1 (µm²), ANT-2 (µm²), ANT-3 (mm²), and ANT-4 (mm²), for different 
aspects of the proposed Vivaldi antennas. Furthermore, the paper conducted analyses of four different Vivaldi antenna structures within the frequency 
range of 0.06 THz to 0.065 THz, as well as in the millimeter-wave frequency band ranging from 0.56 THz to 0.74 THz.  

International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 5, no 7, pp 911-920 July 2024                                     915 
 
 
(Ansha et al., 2021) utilized an antenna design featuring a split ring resonator (SRR) slotted waveguide array was proposed. This antenna demonstrated 
a 10 dB impedance bandwidth spanning 88 GHz, ranging from 0.244 THz to 0.332 THz. Additionally, an axial ratio bandwidth of 35.71 GHz, covering 
frequencies from 0.25172 THz to 0.28751 THz, was achieved. The study included investigations into parametric variations of slot width and split gap, 
analyzing their effects on return loss and gain characteristics of the antenna. This research highlights the importance of optimizing slot geometry and split 
configurations to achieve desired performance metrics in terms of impedance bandwidth and axial ratio over a wide frequency range in the terahertz 
spectrum.  
The referenced paper by (Xu et al., 2020) provides a comprehensive review of antennas showcasing advancements in wideband and high-gain sub-
millimeter wave and low-THz frequencies. It presents a comparative analysis of the performance of these antennas. Additionally, the paper explores an 
all-metal model inspired by Fabry-Perot cavity (FPC) theory and its application in THz communications. A notable contribution of the study is the 
development of a wideband, high-gain resonant cavity antenna (RCA) designed to operate at 300 GHz. Despite being fabricated at a size ten times larger 
than the operational frequency (30 GHz), the antenna was successfully produced using metal binder jetting technology, a form of 3D printing.  
Lastly, (Kosogor & Tikhov, 2020) design a Sub-THz offset Cassegrain antenna for multi-Gbps applications. The antenna was demonstrated within the 
frequency range of 0.22-0.3 THz (220-300 GHz). The primary objective of the study was to assess the feasibility of employing an offset dual-reflector 
configuration to achieve high gain and wideband characteristics for sub-THz point-to-point radio communication. The antenna design featured a conical 
horn feed combined with a rectangular waveguide section incorporating a smooth E-plane bend of 35.6°. The antenna was configured for linear (vertical) 
polarization. Additionally, the weight of the antenna was specified at 640 grams.

technology, and its results were summarized.

3.4 Fabrication 
LCP Technology: (B. Zhang et al., 2016) discussed LCP (Liquid Crystal Polymer) technology, highlighting its advantages such as low material cost and 
compatibility with low-cost processes like wet etching. Ji et al. described LCP as an organic thermoplastic with high temperature resistance, low moisture 
absorption, and good mechanical properties, making it ideal for fabrication of millimeter wave devices (Ji et al., 2020). Similarly, studies focusing on 
LCP technologies for terahertz (THz) applications emphasized its characteristics including high flame resistance, dielectric stability, mechanical strength, 
and compatibility with standard photolithography when laminated with copper claddings (Zhou et al., 2022). LCP is considered more suitable for THz 
applications compared to silica glass and PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), which can be challenging to process (Cuneray & Akcam, 2019). Due to its 
capabilities in multi-layer organic processing, LCP has emerged as a promising material for RF (Radio Frequency) and THz applications, offering 
advantages in terms of fabrication flexibility and performance characteristics. 
PCB Technology: (Chi et al., 2020; Kushwaha & Karuppanan, 2019; Lamminen et al., 2020) discussed the utilization of PCB (Printed Circuit Board) 
fabrication technology in their studies. Printed circuit board technology has been used to establish electrical connections through surface metal etch and 
plating vias (Chi et al., 2020). The study focused on constructing a two-layer PCB with metal walls using grounded vias (GV) and connected grounded 
vias (CGV) for enhanced performance. In (Lamminen et al., 2020) the PCB technology has been specifically applied to D-band applications using the 
semi additive processing of conductors multilayered on a substrate. This method has allowed the creation of antennas suitable for HF applications. 
Similarly, (Kushwaha & Karuppanan, 2019), traditional PCB etching procedures were used to fabricate tested antennas. New research has brought 
attention to the positive results of PCB production techniques for 6G communications and terahertz (THz) applications. This was made evident in recent 
studies, as cited in (Buttazzoni et al., 2023; Dao et al., 2024). 
Topas Fabrication: The main process involved in manufacturing HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) is producing the HDPE material itself. This material 
is commonly utilized for applications like antenna enclosures and support structures (Anik et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Shevchik-Shekera et al., 2023). 
(Campo et al., 2021) made a polarizer from Topas material which was fabricated, with an HDPE lens incorporated on top of it. 
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Machining: The authors used CNC Computer Numerical Control machining to precisely design the paraboloidal 
profile of the top reflector and the convex hyperboloid profile of the sub reflector, according to (Kosogor & Tikhov, 2020). CNC machining, known for 
its accuracy in making complex shapes and profiles, is a flexible method that can be used. Studies investigating the effects of surface roughness from 
various fabrication technologies, including CNC machining, have shown that nano CNC machining offers superior performance with minimal loss (D. 
O. Kim et al., 2023). Additionally, research has highlighted CNC machining as an energy-efficient and cost-effective fabrication method (Xiao et al., 
2021). 
3D Printing Technology: (Wu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020) both utilized 3D printing fabrication technology in their studies. Wu employed 3D printing to 
create the circularly polarized (CP) lens using a process that utilizes a laser to solidify isotropic parts from liquid photopolymer resin. While Xu utilized 
3D printing, along with additive manufacturing (AM) to manufacture the complex antenna structure of the study, ensuring high precision at a low cost. 
This approach highlights the versatility and effectiveness of 3D printing technology in antenna fabrication. Several other studies have also adopted 3D 
printing technology for antenna fabrication, as evidenced by references (Chudpooti et al., 2021; Ribeiro et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; J. C. Zhang et al., 
2023). 
Wire Cutting EDM: The electric discharge machining (EDM) process is a non-traditional thermal-based machining technique commonly employed for 
machining hard materials like ceramics and superalloys (Gupta et al., 2020). (Aqlan et al., 2020) used Wire-cutting EDM fabrication technology to create 
a compact and highly efficient circularly polarized conical horn antenna 

International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews, Vol 5, no 7, pp 911-920 July 2024                                     917 
 
 
Laser-drilling: (Emara et al., 2020) used laser drilling fabrication technology to realize bridge-connected dielectric resonators. This approach enabled 
accurate prototyping of small resonator dimensions without mechanical vibrations, resulting in very low fabrication tolerances. Similarly, several 6G 
(sixth generation) applications have utilized laser-drilling processes to facilitate more cost-effective manufacturing techniques, as highlighted in previous 
studies (Jia et al., 2022; J. W. Kim et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Zetterstrom et al., 2024). This indicates the growing trend of leveraging laser drilling for 
precision manufacturing in high-frequency and advanced wireless communication applications. 
CMOS technology: In the study of (Tabatabaeian, 2021) the proposed antenna was fabricated using CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-
Semiconductor) technology and TSV (Through-Silicon Via) processes. These fabrication techniques were utilized for defining and creating the diameter 
and pitch of the cylindrical part of the antenna. Similar fabrication technology has been employed in recent studies, such as the design of a miniaturized 
substrate integrated waveguide bandpass filter for THz applications (Wang et al., 2020). Recent research highlights the viability of CMOS technology 
and TSV fabrication for applications involving millimeter-wave (mm-wave) and terahertz (THz) integrated circuits (Alibakhshikenari et al., 2021). This 
underscores the growing importance and potential of these fabrication methods in advancing technologies for high-frequency applications.

---

### 3.3 Effective Permittivity Calculation

**Equation (3): Effective Relative Permittivity**

Where:
- **ε_eff** = Effective relative permittivity
- **ε_r** = Relative permittivity of substrate (3 for RO3003)
