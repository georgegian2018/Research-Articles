## 3. RETURN LOSS

### Definition

Return loss is a measurement that determines how efficiently electricity is transferred from a transmission line to a load (such as an antenna).

### Formula

$$\text{Return Loss (RL)} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{P_{in}}{P_{ref}}\right) \text{ dB}$$

Where:
- $P_{in}$ = Power incident on the antenna under test (AUT)
- $P_{ref}$ = Power reflected back to the source

### Physical Interpretation

- **RL is positive** when $P_{ref} < P_{in}$ (desirable condition)
- Higher power ratio indicates better matching between the load and transmission line
- The power ratio displays the influence of the traveling wave and represents the mismatch between occurrence and observation

### Performance Criteria

**Ideal Impedance Matching:**
- Return loss value must be **less than -10 dB** for accurate impedance matching
- This is ideal for mobile or wireless technology
- The frequency at which this occurs has been set as the necessary frequency for the antenna to work correctly

### S-Parameter Analysis

- S-parameters provide the most straightforward method for explaining input and output of signal sources
- Not all power generated is sent to the load (some is reflected)

---

## 4. VSWR, RADIATION PATTERN, GAIN, AND SURFACE CURRENT

### Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)

**Definition:** The ratio between maximum and minimum voltage magnitudes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Perfect Case:** VSWR = 1:1 (no power reflected from source)
- **Real-World Excellent:** VSWR = 1.2:1 (or 1.2)
- **Interpretation:** 1.2:1 means maximum standing wave amplitude is 1.2 times larger than minimum standing wave value

**Performance Guidelines:**
- VSWR should be a positive, real number
- **Lower VSWR = Better antenna performance**
- Acceptable range: 1 ≤ VSWR ≤ 2
- Ideal case: VSWR = 1

**Physical Meaning:** Measures the power that the antenna reflects and elucidates the impedance matching method used.

### Radiation Pattern

**Significance:** Most significant and distinguishing feature in determining microstrip patch antenna performance

**Importance:** Essential metric that explains how well the antenna operates in terms of directional radiation characteristics.

### Antenna Gain

**Definition:** Crucial component in determining overall antenna performance

**Measurement Challenges:**
- Antenna gain can only be accurately determined under specific real-world conditions
- Increasingly critical for system engineers to estimate antenna sizes precisely

**Performance Requirement:**
- Gain must be positive for the antenna to work well in the frequency band
- Essential for important wireless communication applications

**Units:** Measured in decibels (dB)

### Surface Current

**Physical Origin:** Electromagnetic field outside water causes surface current (natural electric current)

**Current Density Characteristics:**
- Electric surface current density on conducting surfaces is unknown
- Electric and magnetic surface current densities on dielectric surfaces are strange

**Field Generation:** These currents and the wind blowing through the dielectric zone create the electric and magnetic fields in the area.

## 3. Return Loss Characteristics

### Definition and Physical Significance

Return loss is a fundamental measurement parameter that quantifies how efficiently electrical power is transferred from a transmission line to a load (antenna). It directly indicates the quality of impedance matching between the transmission line and antenna input.

### Mathematical Formula

$$\text{Return Loss (RL)} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{P_{in}}{P_{ref}}\right) \text{ dB}$$

**Parameter Definitions:**
- $P_{in}$ = Incident power arriving at the antenna under test
- $P_{ref}$ = Reflected power returning to the source
- RL = Return loss value (expressed in decibels)

### Interpretation Guidelines

**Return Loss Value Characteristics:**
- RL is a **positive quantity** when $P_{ref} < P_{in}$ (ideal matching condition)
- Represents the ratio of incident to reflected power
- Expressed in decibels (dB) for convenient logarithmic scaling

**Power Matching Concept:**
The power ratio $P_{in}/P_{ref}$ displays:
- The influence of the traveling wave on the system
- The mismatch level between incident and reflected power
- The effectiveness of impedance matching

### Performance Standards

**Acceptable Performance Threshold:**
- Return loss value must be **less than -10 dB** (which means actual RL = 10 dB as positive value)
- This value represents accurate impedance matching
- Essential for efficient antenna operation in mobile or wireless technology

**Frequency-Specific Optimization:**
- The return loss value must be achieved at the intended operating frequency
- The antenna operating frequency should be set as the necessary frequency for correct system operation
- Frequency tuning may be required through design parameter adjustment

### S-Parameter Relationship

**S-Parameter Method:**
- S-parameters provide the most straightforward explanation of signal sources' input and output
- Not all generated power reaches the antenna load
- Some portion is reflected back to the source
- S₁₁ parameter specifically describes return loss characteristics

## 4. VSWR, Radiation Pattern, Gain, and Surface Current

### Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)

**Definition:**
The VSWR is the ratio between the maximum and minimum voltage magnitudes in a transmission line.

**Physical Interpretation:**
- Measures standing wave ratio formed due to signal reflection
- When VSWR = 1:1 (perfect match), **no power** is reflected from source
- Represents the degree of impedance matching

**Practical Performance Levels:**

*Ideal Condition:*
- VSWR = 1:1 (theoretical perfect impedance match)
- No reflected power
- Rarely achieved in practical applications

*Real-World Excellent Performance:*
- VSWR = 1.2:1 (or simply 1.2)
- Meaning: Maximum standing wave voltage = 1.2 × Minimum standing wave voltage
- Represents excellent practical impedance matching

**VSWR Performance Range:**
- Acceptable range: 1 ≤ VSWR ≤ 2
- Optimal target: VSWR < 1.2
- Poor performance: VSWR > 2

**Performance Relationship:**
- **Lower VSWR value = Better antenna performance**
- VSWR reflects the fraction of power that antenna rejects
- Indicates the effectiveness of impedance matching in transmission line

### Radiation Pattern

**Significance:**
The radiation pattern is the most significant and distinguishing feature in determining microstrip patch antenna performance.

**Physical Meaning:**
- Describes how the antenna radiates electromagnetic energy in different directions
- Shows gain variations as a function of angle (elevation and azimuth)
- Characterizes directional properties

**Importance:**
- Essential metric for understanding antenna operation quality
- Critical for system design and performance prediction
- Determines antenna suitability for specific applications

**Pattern Characteristics:**
- **Main lobe:** Direction of maximum radiation intensity
- **Side lobes:** Secondary radiation directions
- **Null directions:** Directions of minimal radiation
- **Beamwidth:** Angular width of main radiation lobe

### Antenna Gain

**Definition:**
Antenna gain is a crucial performance parameter that measures the ability of an antenna to direct radiated power in a preferred direction compared to an isotropic radiator.

**Units of Measurement:**
- Decibels (dB)
- dBi (decibels relative to isotropic radiator)

**Physical Significance:**
- Measures the antenna's directivity combined with efficiency
- Directly affects communication system range and performance
- Higher gain enables longer communication distances

**Measurement Challenges:**
- Antenna gain determination requires specific real-world conditions
- Direct measurement may be impractical in many situations
- Computational prediction through simulation becomes increasingly essential

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Gain must be positive** for effective antenna operation
- Essential for important wireless communication applications
- Single element typical gain: 3-7 dBi at 3.5 GHz
- Array configurations achieve gains: 10+ dBi

**System Impact:**
System engineers must estimate antenna gain with precision as wireless application quantities continue to increase, making accurate characterization critical for:
- Link budget calculations
- System capacity planning
- Coverage predictions
- Performance optimization

### Surface Current

**Physical Origin:**
Electromagnetic fields external to conductive surfaces cause surface currents - natural electric currents flowing on the conductor surface.

**Current Characteristics:**

*On Conducting Surfaces:*
- Electric surface current density (J_e) is present
- Creates the primary radiation mechanism
- Distribution determines radiation pattern shape

*On Dielectric Surfaces:*
- Electric surface current density (J_e) behaves peculiarly
- Magnetic surface current density (J_m) may be induced
- Both contribute to field creation in surrounding space

**Physical Effect:**
- Surface currents and electromagnetic fields flowing through the dielectric region
- Together produce the electric and magnetic fields throughout the antenna region
- Current distribution determines radiation characteristics

**Practical Importance:**
- Current distribution visualization reveals radiation mechanism
- Helps optimize antenna performance
- Identifies current concentration and distribution patterns
- Supports impedance matching optimization

### VSWR (definition/context)

4. 
VSWR, RADIATION PATTERN, GAIN, AND SURFACE CURRENT 
The ratio between maximum and minimum voltage is known as the VSWR. No power is reflected 
from the source when the VSWR equals 1:1. This is a picture-perfect scenario that only some people, if ever, 
get to experience in real life. In almost all circumstances, a VSWR of 1.2:1 (or 1.2) is considered outstanding 
in the real world. The number 1.2:1 for the VSWR signifies that the maximum standing wave amplitude is 
1.2 times bigger than the minimum standing wave value [15]. It is a measure of the power that the antenna 
reflects. The value of the VSWR should be a number that is both positive and actual. The lower the VSWR 
number, the better the antenna's performance. It elucidates the method used to match the impedance of the 
transmission line. The VSWR bandwidth should have a value that is neither greater than 2 nor lower than 1. 
In the best possible scenario, it is 1. In the ideal case, it is 1 [16]. 
In the process of determining how well a microstrip patch antenna performs, the radiation pattern is 
the most significant and distinguishing feature to keep in mind. Therefore, it is an essential metric since it 
explains how well the antenna operates. The gain of an antenna is a crucial component in determining its 
overall performance. Measuring or determining the payment of an antenna is only achievable in some 
conditions that occur in the real world. It is also becoming increasingly critical for system engineers to 
estimate antenna sizes precisely as the number of wireless applications continues to rise in popularity [17]. 
The gain must be positive for the antenna to work well in the frequency band for important wireless 
communication [18]. An electromagnetic field outside the water causes the surface current, a natural electric 
current [13]. This makes the electric surface current density on the conducting surfaces unknown and the 
electric and magnetic surface current densities on the dielectric surfaces strange. These currents and the wind 
that blows through the dielectric zone are what cause the electric and magnetic fields in the area [19].

ANALYSIS OF THE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED WORKS 
Researchers are currently focusing more on microstrip patch antennas. One reason is that many 
types of software can be used for antenna design. Also, the antenna can be manufactured cheaply and in less 
time. People's demands for wireless applications are increasing daily. One of them is this patch antenna. The 
antenna is a vital part of wireless communication. It sends an electromagnetic wave between two points to 
connect them. Antennas are utilized in various settings and configurations, and their utilization is prevalent. 
Return loss, gain, directivity, VSWR, surface current, efficiency, and bandwidth are all aspects of 
performance that can be expected from the antenna [45]. At 3.5 GHz, the values for dielectric permittivity, 
return loss, directivity gain, VSWR, and bandwidth are all listed in Table 1.

MICROSTRIP PATCH ANTENNA 
The microstrip antenna patch antenna was a completely original design that only existed in 1955. A 
microstrip antenna is made up of a portion of the substrate that is composed of a dielectric substance and is 
sandwiched between two plates of conducting material. Although the lower bearing surface is also known as 
the ground plane, the higher conducting plate is referred to as a patch. Both of these terms are used 
interchangeably. Because the fabrication process for microstrip antennas is comparable to that of printed 
circuit boards, the term "printed antennas" is occasionally used to refer to these antennas. There are a number 
of aspects that determine the performance of the microstrip antenna, with the size and contour of the patch 
being two of the most essential of these elements. The performance of a microstrip patch antenna is reliant on 
various factors, including its length, width, substrate thickness, the dielectric constant of the substance that 
makes up the substrate, and the placement of the feed line [8]. The construction of the microstrip patch 
antenna is illustrated in Figure 2.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Microstrip patch antenna's overall geometric layout 
 
 
The microstrip patch antenna, also known as an MPA, is constructed by stacking the substrate and 
the metal in a three-layer stack. Copper or another material with solid conductivity is often used to build the 
ground structure, which is the layer that is the lowest in the system. In addition to air, FR4, Rogers, or any 
other dielectric substrate, the intermediate substrate layer may also be something else. The topmost layer, 
often known as the patch or design layer, is either composed of a substance that is highly conductive or uses 
copper as its foundation [9], [10]. Figure 3 shows all microstrip antennas can be organized into one of these 
four primary categories [11].

Figure 4 shows the microstrip line feed patch antenna. It is one of the easiest ways to make a line 
feed because all you need is a conducting strip connected to the patch. Because of this, it may be considered 
an extension of the patch itself. Also, Figure 5 shows a proximity-coupled microstrip patch antenna. The 
bandwidth of proximity coupling is the largest, producing very little spurious radiation. The width-to-length 
ratio of the patch as well as the length of the feeding stub, determines the control of the match. The nature of 
its coupling mechanism can be described as capacitive [11].

## Design Techniques, Configurations, and Methodologies
```text
microstrip antenna design is utilised, and 
the relevant slots are positioned in the ideal locations. Feeding tactics are used to provide an antenna with a 
source so that it can perform its purpose. A microstrip feed line technique, a coaxial feed technique, an 
aperture coupling feeding technique, and a proximity coupling technique are the four approaches that are 
going to be explored in this article [22]. This section will discuss many kinds of 3.5 GHz microstrip patch 
antennas published in international journals and conferences. Several authors have written high-quality 
papers about microstrip patch antennas for international journals and conferences, and they have been talked 
about.
