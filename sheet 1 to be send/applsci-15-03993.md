## Section 3: Equations and Mathematical Models

### Equation 1: Resonant Frequencies for Rectangular Microstrip Antenna

$$f_{mn} = \frac{c}{2\sqrt{\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}}}\sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{L_{\text{eff}}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{W_{\text{eff}}}\right)^2}$$

**Parameters:**
- $f_{mn}$ = Resonant frequency for TM modes
- $c$ = Speed of light in free space (3 × 10⁸ m/s)
- $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective relative permittivity of substrate
- $m, n$ = Mode indices (integers)
- $L_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective length of patch
- $W_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective width of patch

**Physical Significance:**
Determines the resonant frequency based on patch dimensions and substrate properties. The equation accounts for the effects of fringing fields through the effective dimensions.

**Application in Design:**
Used to calculate initial patch dimensions for target frequencies of 28 GHz and 38 GHz. The fundamental TM₁₀ mode (m=1, n=0) is most commonly used for microstrip patch antennas.

---

### Equation 2: Fundamental TM₁₀ Mode Resonant Frequency

$$f_{10} = \frac{c}{2L_{\text{eff}}\sqrt{\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}}}$$

**Parameters:**
- $f_{10}$ = Resonant frequency for fundamental TM₁₀ mode
- $c$ = Speed of light
- $L_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective length of patch
- $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective relative permittivity

**Physical Significance:**
Simplified form for primary resonance calculation. The effective length $L_{\text{eff}}$ is approximately half the guided wavelength at resonance.

---

### Equation 3: Effective Length with Fringing Field Extension

$$L_{\text{eff}} = L + 2\Delta L$$

**Parameters:**
- $L_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective electrical length
- $L$ = Physical patch length
- $\Delta L$ = Length extension due to fringing fields (applied on both ends)

**Physical Significance:**
Accounts for the fringing fields extending beyond physical patch edges. These fields effectively increase the electrical length compared to the physical dimension.

**Application:**
Essential for accurate resonance frequency prediction. Fringing effects become more pronounced at higher frequencies due to smaller physical dimensions.

---

### Equation 4: Effective Relative Permittivity (Schneider Equation)

$$\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\varepsilon_r + 1}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{2}\left(1 + 12\frac{h}{W}\right)^{-1/2}$$

**Parameters:**
- $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective relative permittivity
- $\varepsilon_r$ = Material relative permittivity (Rogers 5880: εᵣ = 2.2)
- $h$ = Substrate thickness (1.6 mm)
- $W$ = Patch width

**Physical Significance:**
Accounts for nonuniform electric field distribution between patch and ground plane. Field partially exists in substrate (high ε) and partially in air (ε = 1), resulting in effective permittivity between the two values.

**Numerical Example:**
For Rogers 5880 (εᵣ = 2.2), h = 1.6 mm, W = 15 mm:
$\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} \approx 1.8–1.9$ (reduced from material value 2.2)

---

### Equation 5: Fringing Field Length Extension (Hammerstad Equation)

$$\Delta L = 0.412\frac{h(\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} + 0.3)\left(\frac{W}{h} + 0.264\right)}{(\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} - 0.258)\left(\frac{W}{h} + 0.8\right)}$$

**Parameters:**
- $\Delta L$ = Extension length due to fringing fields
- $h$ = Substrate thickness
- $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective relative permittivity
- $W$ = Patch width

**Physical Significance:**
Empirical formula providing accurate fringing field correction. Extension is more pronounced for thicker substrates and wider patches.

**Design Impact:**
Physical patch length must be reduced by 2ΔL to achieve desired resonant frequency.

---

### Equation 6: Return Loss (S₁₁) Parameter

$$S_{11} = 20\log_{10}\left|\frac{Z_{\text{in}} - Z_0}{Z_{\text{in}} + Z_0}\right| \text{ (dB)}$$

**Parameters:**
- $S_{11}$ = Return loss (decibels, negative value)
- $Z_{\text{in}}$ = Antenna input impedance
- $Z_0$ = Characteristic impedance (50 Ω)

**Physical Interpretation:**
Measures power reflection at antenna input. Lower (more negative) values indicate better impedance matching and greater power transmission.

**Performance Standards:**
- $S_{11}$ < −10 dB: Acceptable (90% power transfer)
- $S_{11}$ < −20 dB: Good (99% power transfer)
- $S_{11}$ < −30 dB: Excellent (99.9% power transfer)
- $S_{11}$ < −50 dB: Outstanding (99.999% power transfer)

**Achieved Performance:**
- 28 GHz: −53.04 dB (outstanding)
- 38 GHz: −83.65 dB (outstanding)

---

### Equation 7: Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)

$$\text{VSWR} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}$$

**Parameters:**
- VSWR = Voltage standing wave ratio
- $|\Gamma|$ = Magnitude of reflection coefficient

**Relationship to Return Loss:**
$$|\Gamma| = 10^{-|S_{11}|/20}$$

**Physical Interpretation:**
Ratio of maximum to minimum voltage along transmission line. VSWR = 1 indicates perfect matching; higher values indicate greater mismatch.

---

### Equation 8: Slot Configuration for Dual-Band Operation

**Principle:** Slots create additional current paths with different resonant frequencies, enabling dual-band operation in a single-element antenna.

**Mathematical Basis:**
Secondary resonance frequency can be approximated as:
$$f_2 \approx f_1 + \Delta f_{\text{slot}}$$

Where $\Delta f_{\text{slot}}$ depends on slot depth, width, and position.

**Application in Design:**
- Side slots (parameters p, o): Control field distribution and secondary resonance
- Bottom slots (parameters l, m): Fine-tune impedance matching and bandwidth
- Upper slots (parameters r, s): Modify coupling and radiation characteristics

---

### Equation 9: EBG-like Notch Effect

**Principle:** Electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures suppress surface waves and reduce sidelobes.

**Mechanism:**
Notches create periodic structures that establish forbidden bands for certain electromagnetic modes:
- Dimension y: Controls vertical field distribution
- Dimension u: Controls horizontal field distribution

**Surface Wave Suppression:**
By optimizing notch dimensions, surface waves at specific frequencies are eliminated, improving radiation efficiency and reducing sidelobe levels.

# SECTION 1: DIAGRAMS, FIGURES, AND ILLUSTRATIONS

## Figure 1: Antenna Design Components

**Caption:** Antenna design: (a) dielectric layer and patch; (b) ground layer

**Description:**
Panel (a) shows the dielectric layer with the rectangular microstrip patch design including patch dimensions, gaps, and slots positioned strategically. Key parameters include patch width (yw = 15 mm), patch length (yl = 14 mm), and top gap dimensions (g = 0.83 mm, h = 5.41 mm). The feed line configuration is visible at the patch feed point. Panel (b) displays the ground plane structure with rectangular conducting layer. Ground plane dimensions are referenced as dw (width = 30 mm) and dl (length = 28 mm), serving as the return path for electromagnetic energy. The overall structure is optimized for dual-band operation at 28/38 GHz.

## Figure 2: S11 Parameters of the Proposed Antenna

**Caption:** S11 parameters of the proposed antenna

**Description:**
Simulation results show return loss across the frequency range with two prominent resonance dips visible at the target frequencies. The first resonance occurs at approximately 26.6 GHz with S11 ≈ −50 dB, while the second resonance appears at approximately 38.6 GHz with S11 ≈ −50 dB. The frequency range extends from 20–45 GHz, with S11 values well below the −10 dB threshold at both operating bands. The design adjustments, including patch sizing and geometric optimizations, result in strong impedance matching and high performance at both target frequencies. The antenna's usable bandwidth is determined by the frequency ranges where S11 remains below −10 dB, with sufficient bandwidth confirmed at 26.6 and 38.6 GHz bands.

## Figure 3: SMP Connector Design in Antenna Magus

**Caption:** SMP connector design in Antenna Magus

**Description:**
The illustration shows the integrated 2.92-mm SMP connector with its feed line interface. The SMP connector is rated for 0–40 GHz operation and was integrated using Antenna Magus software (version 2022). The connector geometry is modeled for accurate electromagnetic simulation, which is critical for assessing connector-induced effects on antenna performance at millimeter-wave frequencies.

## Figure 4: Comparison of S11 Parameters With and Without Connector

**Caption:** Comparison of S11 parameters for antenna design with and without a connector

**Description:**
The blue curve represents antenna performance without the SMP connector, while the red curve depicts the antenna performance with the integrated SMP connector. The comparison shows clear degradation in performance after connector integration. Frequency shifts are visible in both resonance peaks, and S11 values increase (become less negative) with the connector present. The connector causes an increase in signal reflection, leading to less efficient radiation and impedance matching. Specifically, at 28 GHz, the performance degrades by approximately 3–5 dB. This demonstrates that connector effects cannot be neglected in high-frequency design and that a structure without a connector would be unsuccessful in manufacturing.

## Figure 5: Comparison of Optimization Results for S11 Parameter

**Caption:** Comparison of optimization results for the S11 parameter

**Description:**
The figure shows four optimized antenna configurations (Opt-1, Opt-2, Opt-3, Opt-4), each represented by a distinct curve. All curves display dual resonances at the targeted frequency bands with progressively improved S11 values through optimization iterations. The parameter adjustments include modifications to the top, side, and bottom gap dimensions, using the Trust Region Framework (TRF) algorithm for optimization. The figure demonstrates the efficacy of the parametric optimization process in progressively enhancing impedance matching and overall antenna performance.

## Figure 6: S11 Values From Parametric Analyses

**Caption:** S11 values corresponding to parametric analyses: (a) arm spacing width (g), (b) arm spacing height (h), (c) upper gap width (r), (d) upper gap height (s)

**Description:**
Panel (a) shows arm spacing width (g) variations in the range 0.4–1.5 mm with step sizes of 0.15–0.5 mm, illustrating how variations affect S11 at both frequencies. Panel (b) displays arm spacing height (h) variations in the range 4–8.5 mm, demonstrating a pronounced impact on S11 values. The parametric analysis identifies arm spacing as a critical parameter. Panel (c) shows upper gap width (r) variations in the range 1.3–2.1 mm with 0.1 mm steps, exhibiting limited influence on S11 compared to arm spacing. Panel (d) shows upper gap height (s) variations in the range 1.9–2.8 mm with 0.1 mm steps, displaying relatively modest impact on return loss. Results indicate that arm spacing has a more pronounced effect than upper gap dimensions on overall antenna performance.

## Figure 7: S11 Parametric Analysis

**Caption:** S11 parametric analysis of the (a) arm spacing (g, h) and (b) upper gap (r, s)

**Description:**
Panel (a) shows the arm spacing combinations (g, h) in a 2D analysis, revealing interaction effects between parameters. These ranges were optimized to minimize manufacturing deviations. The analysis focuses on robustness against fabrication tolerances. Panel (b) displays the 2D parametric analysis of upper gap combinations (r, s), demonstrating slot dimension variations that are fine-tuned to minimize performance deviations. This approach ensures antenna consistency across the frequency range and accounts for manufacturing tolerances.

## Figure 8: Parametric Analysis of Slot Dimensions

**Caption:** Parametric analysis of slot dimensions and their effects on dual-band performance: (a) side slot width (p), (b) side slot length (o), (c) bottom slot width (l), and (d) bottom slot length (m)

**Description:**
Panel (a) analyzes side slot width (p), which influences field distribution, impedance bandwidth, and resonance stability. Panel (b) examines side slot length (o), which is crucial for shaping secondary resonance by modifying effective inductance and capacitance. Panel (c) investigates bottom slot width (l), which governs coupling strength, bandwidth, and radiation efficiency. Panel (d) analyzes bottom slot length (m), which impacts the effective electrical path and affects both impedance matching and resonance characteristics. All analyses use 10% step intervals with notch structures examined at 100% dimensional variation. Results show that side slot width primarily affects horizontal current distribution with noticeable shifts in lower resonance frequency, while side slot height has more pronounced effects on impedance matching.

## Figure 9: Antenna Model of the Final Design

**Caption:** Antenna model of the final design

**Description:**
The complete 3D representation of the optimized dual-band antenna shows all geometric features and slot configurations. The visualization displays the dielectric layer, patch, ground plane, and feed line configuration integrated together. The dimensions reflect the final optimization results as summarized in Table 2. The antenna maintains a compact overall form factor of 33 × 27 × 1.6 mm³.

## Figure 10: S11 Performance at Different Frequencies

**Caption:** S11 performance at different frequencies

**Description:**
A comprehensive frequency sweep from 20–45 GHz shows two distinct resonance valleys. The primary band shows S11 = −53.04 dB at 28.08 GHz, while the secondary band exhibits S11 = −83.65 dB at 37.9 GHz. The bandwidth at −10 dB threshold is 1.12 GHz at the 28 GHz band (27.63–28.75 GHz) and 1.27 GHz at the 38 GHz band (37.33–38.60 GHz). The between-band region maintains adequate S11 performance, confirming excellent dual-band operation.

## Figure 11: Three-Dimensional Radiation Pattern

**Caption:** Three-dimensional radiation pattern of the final antenna design at (a) 28 GHz and (b) 38 GHz

**Description:**
Panel (a) shows the 3D radiation pattern at 28 GHz with directional radiation characteristics and a main lobe. The side lobes are present due to equal dimensions of the ground and insulator layers combined with the use of Rogers 5880 RT/duroid substrate. The directivity at this frequency is 8.02 dBi with efficiency of 96.02%. Panel (b) illustrates the 3D radiation pattern at 38 GHz, showing similar directional characteristics with a more concentrated radiation pattern. At 38 GHz, the directivity reaches 9.17 dBi with efficiency of 95.50%. Despite the presence of side lobes, the antenna achieves significantly higher gain than typical literature averages due to the deliberate choice of low-dielectric substrate material.

**Caption:** Realized gain and total antenna efficiency of the designed antenna

**Description:**
The figure demonstrates gain performance across the frequency range, with realized gain at 28 GHz reaching 7.82 dBi and at 38 GHz reaching 8.98 dBi. These gains are maintained across the operational bandwidth. Total antenna efficiency reaches 96.02% at 28 GHz and 95.50% at 38 GHz, indicating minimal losses throughout the system. These efficiency values demonstrate superior operational performance, and the gain values exceed typical single-element antenna performance (which is generally limited to around 5 dBi).

# SECTION 3: EQUATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS

## Equation 1: Resonant Frequencies for Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna

$$f_{mn} = \frac{c}{2\sqrt{\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}}}\sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{L_{\text{eff}}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{W_{\text{eff}}}\right)^2}$$

**Parameters:**
- $f_{mn}$ = Resonant frequency for transverse magnetic modes (TM)
- $c$ = Speed of light in free space: 3 × 10⁸ m/s
- $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective relative permittivity of substrate
- $m, n$ = Mode indices (positive integers: 0, 1, 2, 3,...)
- $L_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective length of patch including fringing field correction
- $W_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective width of patch including fringing field correction

**Physical Significance:**
This fundamental equation determines the resonant frequency based on patch physical dimensions and substrate electromagnetic properties. The equation accounts for the effects of fringing fields through the effective dimensions. Different combinations of m and n values produce different resonant modes, with TM₁₀ being the fundamental mode most commonly used.

**Application in Design:**
Used to calculate initial patch dimensions for the target frequencies of 28 GHz and 38 GHz. The equation provides a starting point for the iterative optimization process. By adjusting L_eff and W_eff through slot configurations, dual-band operation is achieved.

---

## Equation 2: Fundamental TM₁₀ Mode Resonant Frequency

$$f_{10} = \frac{c}{2L_{\text{eff}}\sqrt{\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}}}$$

**Parameters:**
- $f_{10}$ = Resonant frequency for fundamental TM₁₀ mode
- $c$ = Speed of light in free space
- $L_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective length of patch accounting for fringing fields
- $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective relative permittivity

**Physical Significance:**
Simplified form of the general resonance equation for the primary operating mode. The effective length $L_{\text{eff}}$ is approximately half the guided wavelength ($\lambda_g$) at resonance, establishing the fundamental relationship between physical size and resonant frequency.

**Design Application:**
Provides the simplified calculation path used during initial design phase. The TM₁₀ mode dominates antenna behavior and determines the primary resonant frequency at 28 GHz.

---

## Equation 3: Effective Length with Fringing Field Extension

$$L_{\text{eff}} = L + 2\Delta L$$

**Parameters:**
- $L_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective electrical length of patch
- $L$ = Physical patch length (actual dimension measured on substrate)
- $\Delta L$ = Length extension due to fringing fields (applied on both ends)

**Physical Significance:**
This equation accounts for the fringing fields extending beyond the physical patch edges. These electromagnetic fields effectively increase the electrical length compared to the physical dimension. Fringing effects become more pronounced at higher frequencies due to smaller physical dimensions relative to wavelength.

**Application in Design:**
Essential for accurate resonance frequency prediction. Physical patch dimensions must be adjusted downward from calculated values to compensate for the fringing field extension. Without this correction, the fabricated antenna would resonate at higher than intended frequencies.

---

## Equation 4: Effective Relative Permittivity (Schneider Formula)

$$\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\varepsilon_r + 1}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{2}\left(1 + 12\frac{h}{W}\right)^{-1/2}$$

**Parameters:**
- $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective relative permittivity
- $\varepsilon_r$ = Material relative permittivity (Rogers 5880: εᵣ = 2.2)
- $h$ = Substrate thickness (1.6 mm in this design)
- $W$ = Patch width

**Physical Significance:**
Accounts for the nonuniform electric field distribution between the patch and ground plane. The electromagnetic field partially exists within the high-permittivity substrate material and partially in the surrounding air (relative permittivity = 1). The effective permittivity falls between these two extremes, typically around 1.8–1.9 for Rogers 5880.

**Numerical Calculation Example:**
For Rogers 5880 with εᵣ = 2.2, h = 1.6 mm, and W = 15 mm:
- The first term equals (2.2 + 1)/2 = 1.6
- The second term's denominator: 1 + 12(1.6/15) = 2.28
- Result: $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ ≈ 1.85

---

## Equation 5: Fringing Field Length Extension (Hammerstad Formula)

$$\Delta L = 0.412 \frac{h(\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} + 0.3)(\frac{W}{h} + 0.264)}{(\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} - 0.258)(\frac{W}{h} + 0.8)}$$

**Parameters:**
- $\Delta L$ = Extension length due to fringing fields
- $h$ = Substrate thickness (1.6 mm)
- $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective relative permittivity from Equation 4
- $W$ = Patch width (15 mm)

**Physical Significance:**
This empirical formula provides accurate correction for fringing field effects. The extension is more pronounced for thicker substrates and wider patches. The formula accounts for the geometry dependence of edge effects and validates the physical intuition that larger patches experience more significant fringing.

**Design Application:**
Physical patch length must be reduced by 2ΔL to achieve the desired resonant frequency. For this design with h = 1.6 mm and W = 15 mm, ΔL ≈ 0.3–0.4 mm is typical, requiring approximately 0.6–0.8 mm total reduction from the initial calculated length.

---

## Equation 6: Return Loss (S₁₁) Parameter

$$S_{11} = 20\log_{10}\left|\frac{Z_{\text{in}} - Z_0}{Z_{\text{in}} + Z_0}\right| \text{ (dB)}$$

**Parameters:**
- $S_{11}$ = Return loss measured in decibels (always negative for typical antennas)
- $Z_{\text{in}}$ = Antenna input impedance (complex value: R + jX)
- $Z_0$ = Characteristic impedance of transmission line (50 Ω standard)

**Physical Interpretation:**
The S₁₁ parameter measures the fraction of power reflected back toward the source from the antenna. Lower (more negative) S₁₁ values indicate better impedance matching and greater power transmission into radiation.

**Performance Standards (Industry Reference):**
- $S_{11}$ = −10 dB: 90% power transferred, 10% reflected
- $S_{11}$ = −20 dB: 99% power transferred, 1% reflected
- $S_{11}$ = −30 dB: 99.9% power transferred, 0.1% reflected
- $S_{11}$ = −50 dB: 99.999% power transferred, 0.001% reflected
- $S_{11}$ = −83.65 dB: 99.9999999% power transferred (exceptional performance)

**Achieved Performance in This Design:**
- At 28 GHz: −53.04 dB (outstanding performance)
- At 38 GHz: −83.65 dB (exceptional performance, among best reported)

---

## Equation 7: Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) Relationship

$$\text{VSWR} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}$$

**Parameters:**
- VSWR = Voltage standing wave ratio (dimensionless, always ≥ 1.0)
- $|\Gamma|$ = Magnitude of reflection coefficient

**Relationship to Return Loss:**
$$|\Gamma| = 10^{-|S_{11}|/20}$$

**Physical Interpretation:**
VSWR is the ratio of maximum to minimum voltage amplitudes along the transmission line. It results from the interference between incident and reflected waves. VSWR = 1.0 indicates perfect impedance matching with no reflections.

**Typical VSWR Values:**
- VSWR = 1.0: Perfect match (S₁₁ = −∞ dB, theoretical)
- VSWR = 1.5: Good match (S₁₁ ≈ −14 dB, 96% power transfer)
- VSWR = 2.0: Acceptable match (S₁₁ ≈ −10 dB, 89% power transfer)
- VSWR = 3.0: Poor match (S₁₁ ≈ −6 dB, 75% power transfer)

---

## Equation 8: Slot Configuration Impact on Resonant Frequency

**Principle:** Adding slots to a rectangular patch modifies the effective electrical path length, creating additional resonant frequencies for dual-band operation.

**Physical Mechanism:**
Slots alter current distribution patterns on the patch surface. Instead of simple end-to-end current flow characteristic of the fundamental TM₁₀ mode, slots create meandering current paths with different effective electrical lengths.

**Mathematical Basis:**
Secondary resonance frequency can be approximated as:
$$f_2 ≈ f_1 + \Delta f_{\text{slot}}$$

Where $\Delta f_{\text{slot}}$ depends on:
- Slot depth (penetration into patch): Affects inductance
- Slot width: Affects capacitance
- Slot position: Relative to primary current path

**Application in Final Design:**
- Side slots (parameters p = 4.45 mm, o = 0.70 mm): Control field distribution
- Bottom slots (parameters l = 1.40 mm, m = 0.55 mm): Fine-tune impedance matching
- Upper slots (parameters r = 2.05 mm, s = 2.35 mm): Modify coupling and radiation
- Result: Two distinct resonances at 28.07 GHz and 37.90 GHz

---

## Equation 9: EBG-like Notch Surface Wave Suppression

**Principle:** Electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures create forbidden bands for surface wave propagation, suppressing unwanted radiation modes.

**Physical Mechanism:**
Notches establish periodic structures in the patch geometry. These periodic variations create band gaps in the electromagnetic wave spectrum, similar to photonic bandgaps in optics.

**Parameter Effects:**
- Dimension y (vertical notch depth): Controls vertical field distribution and resonance frequency
- Dimension u (horizontal notch extent): Controls horizontal field distribution and impedance characteristics

**Surface Wave Suppression Outcome:**
By optimizing notch dimensions (y = 1.63 mm, u = 0.76 mm), surface waves at specific frequencies are eliminated, resulting in:
- Sidelobe level reduction from −15 dB (Analysis 1) to −2.2 dB (Proposed)
- Radiation efficiency enhancement
- Directivity improvement at 38 GHz

---

## Equation 10: Bandwidth Calculation at −10 dB Return Loss

$$\text{Bandwidth} = f_{\text{high}} - f_{\text{low}}$$

Where $f_{\text{high}}$ and $f_{\text{low}}$ are frequencies where S₁₁ = −10 dB threshold is crossed.

**Physical Interpretation:**
Defines the frequency range over which the antenna maintains acceptable impedance matching (≥90% power transfer).

**Design Achievement:**
- 28 GHz band: 27.63–28.75 GHz = 1.12 GHz bandwidth
- 38 GHz band: 37.33–38.60 GHz = 1.27 GHz bandwidth
- Both bands exceed typical target of 1.0 GHz minimum bandwidth

A detailed comparison of the simulated S11 values and those measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA) is presented in Figure 16, further confirming the consistency and high performance of the antenna across both analysis methods. The discrepancy observed in the S11 value at the second resonance can be attributed to several factors related to the antenna fabrication and measurement process. Specifically, the sensitivity of the printed circuit board (PCB) during fabrication can lead to small variations in the material properties, which may affect the resonance characteristics. Additionally, tolerances in the connectors used and variations in the way the connectors are attached to the PCB can introduce slight differences in the impedance matching, further influencing the S11 values.

Radiation pattern optimization using EBG-like notches
In addition to slot-based optimization and parametric analyses, electromagnetic
bandgap (EBG)-like notches were symmetrically incorporated into the patch to enhance
the radiation pattern, particularly by reducing the sidelobe levels. The notch dimensions,
defined by parameters y and u, were systematically varied in increments of approximately
10% to evaluate their impact on the radiation characteristics. The primary objective of
this optimization was to create a sufficient bandgap to suppress surface waves, thereby

improving the overall radiation performance of the antenna. The simulation results for
different notch configurations are summarized in

2. Antenna Design Stages
The proposed dual-band microstrip antenna was developed systematically to ensure
optimal performance at 28 GHz and 38 GHz for mmWave applications. The design method-
ology integrates precise dielectric material selection, rigorous analytical modeling, and
parametric optimization, all of which are critical for achieving high gain, low return loss,
and enhanced radiation efficiency in next-generation communication systems.
2.1. Antenna Design and Configuration
The dielectric substrate selection plays a pivotal role in determining the microstrip
antenna impedance characteristics, bandwidth, and radiation efficiency, particularly at
mmWave frequencies. To minimize signal attenuation [18] while maintaining structural
stability, this study employs Rogers RT/duroid 5880, a well-established high-frequency
substrate with a dielectric constant (εr) of 2.2 and a low loss tangent (tan δ = 0.0009).
The substrate thickness (h) was set to 1.6 mm to ensure a balance between mechanical
robustness and optimal electromagnetic performance.
The Rogers RT/duroid 5880 is particularly advantageous for millimeter wave applica-
tions, where excessive propagation losses can significantly degrade antenna efficiency. The
low-loss properties of this material make it highly suitable for 5G and other systems, in
which maintaining signal integrity and minimizing power dissipation are paramount.
Once the dielectric material was selected, the physical dimensions of the radiating
patch, specifically its width (W) and length (L), were determined using well-established
microstrip antenna design principles [19]. Achieving dual-band operation in single-element
microstrip antennas requires approaches beyond classical mathematical models. The most
commonly used techniques in the literature include slot configurations, the incorporation
of notches in the patch geometry to achieve similar effects, the use of multiple resonant
structures on the patch, the integration of short-circuit pins, and adjustments to the feed
line configuration.
For the designed antenna to operate at dual-band frequencies of 28/38 GHz, the effect
of notches on the patch is analyzed using slot configurations. The resonant frequencies
(fmn) for a classic rectangular microstrip antenna are given in Equation (1) [19–21].

where εeff is the effective relative permittivity of the patch, c is the speed of light in free
space, and m and n are mode indices. The parameters Leff and Weff represent the effective
length and width of the patch, respectively.
The resonant frequency fmn at the fundamental TM10 mode can be determined using
Equation (1). Additionally, the effective length Leff is defined as follows:

where εeff is the effective relative permittivity of the patch, c is the speed of light in free
space, and m and n are mode indices. The parameters Leff and Weff represent the effective
length and width of the patch, respectively.
The resonant frequency fmn at the fundamental TM10 mode can be determined using
Equation (1). Additionally, the effective length Leff is defined as follows:

The effective relative permittivity (εeff) accounts for the nonuniform electric field
distribution between the patch and the ground plane and is determined using the equation

Due to the presence of fringing fields, there is difference between the electrical and
physical dimensions of the antenna. The extension length ∆L caused by these fields can be
estimated using the equation provided by Hammerstad [22,23].

These extensions influence resonance and impedance matching, necessitating precise
adjustments in the final design [24,25].
Adding slots or notches to a rectangular microstrip patch antenna changes the surface
current paths and increases the antenna’s electrical length, creating additional resonant










frequencies. This approach is widely used for dual-band or multiband operation [26].
Creating an upper gap at the radiation edge is particularly effective for achieving
dual resonance. A compact microstrip patch antenna with inverted C-shaped and U-
shaped slots functions as two connected resonators of different sizes. These slots guide
meandering currents, generating multiple resonances. Dual-band operation can be achieved
by strategically placing slots on the radiating patch, ground plane, or feed line, with the
slot dimensions manually tuned to optimize performance [27].
Slots positioned at the radiation edge primarily influence higher-order modes, while
center slots play a key role in generating a secondary frequency by extending the current
path. This increases the effective resonant length and lowers the resonant frequency. Addi-
tionally, center slots suppress symmetric modes, affecting bandwidth and polarization [28].
The shape and placement of the slots significantly impact the antenna’s overall perfor-
mance, influencing resonance, impedance matching, and polarization characteristics [23].
Notches placed near the feed arm of the rectangular patch influence surface currents
and create new resonances. Their effect on the primary resonance is minimal due to their
proximity to the feed arm. The depth of the bottom slot plays a critical role in forming a
secondary resonance, while also affecting coupling coefficients and enabling impedance
matching [29,30].
2.2. Simulation and Optimization
After determining the initial patch dimensions, the antenna design was modeled and
simulated using CST Studio Suite, a widely recognized electromagnetic simulation tool
that is extensively used in high-frequency antenna development. The primary objective
was to achieve robust dual-band operation at 28 GHz and 38 GHz while optimizing critical
performance parameters, such as S11, gain, radiation efficiency, and directivity.
To enhance the accuracy of the simulation and account for real-world implementation
factors, an SMP connector was integrated into the model using Antenna Magus software
2022 (https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/antenna-magus, accessed date 16 Febru-
ary 2025). This addition enabled a more precise evaluation of the connector-induced effects,
which are often overlooked but can significantly impact antenna performance at mmWave
frequencies. The incorporation of the connector allowed for a more realistic assessment of
impedance matching, signal integrity, and potential loss mechanisms.

During the optimization phase, various design parameters were systematically ad-
justed to improve the performance metrics. A detailed parametric analysis was con-
ducted to examine the influence of key geometrical and material properties, including
the following:
■
Patch dimensions: The patch dimensions were modified iteratively to optimize the
impedance matching and enhance the radiation efficiency.
■
Substrate thickness and dielectric constant: Analyzed to balance gain enhancement
with minimal losses, ensuring improved overall efficiency.
■
Feed line configuration: Optimized for better impedance matching and reduced
reflection coefficients.
■
Ground plane modifications: These modifications were performed to fine-tune the
radiation characteristics and improve the bandwidth.
An in-depth sensitivity analysis guided the iterative optimization process to evaluate
the antenna’s resilience against minor manufacturing tolerances. This step is critical for
ensuring minimal deviations due to fabrication inconsistencies. The final design exhibited
significantly improved S11 values, increased gain, and a more stable radiation pattern
across the target frequency bands.
By combining CST-based full-wave simulations with targeted parametric optimiza-
tions and connector integration studies, this research presents a high-performance dual-
band microstrip antenna capable of delivering superior results in next-generation wireless
communication applications.
