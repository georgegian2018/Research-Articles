## Abstract

The sixth generation (6G) wireless technology is designed for advanced applications including immersive reality, autonomous vehicle communication, and holographic communication. Central to 6G systems are RF transceivers, including amplifiers, mixers, and antennas. For 6G to support higher data rates and ensure network reliability in higher frequency bands, antennas need to be simple in design, cost-effective for mass production, and have better radiation performance than 5G antennas. This paper provides a brief review of recent advancements in 6G antenna design, covering deployment scenarios, design methodologies, and radiation characteristics. The paper reviews approximately 50 most promising 6G antenna architectures organized by operating frequencies: mid-frequency band (1–100 GHz) and high-frequency band (above 100 GHz).
