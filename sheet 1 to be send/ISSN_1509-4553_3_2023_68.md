## Section 3: Equations and Mathematical Models

### Equation 1: Effective Dielectric Constant for Microstrip Patch Antenna (MPA)

$$\varepsilon_{r,\text{eff}} = \frac{\varepsilon_r + 1}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{2} \left( 1 + 12 \frac{h}{w} \right)^{-1/2}$$

**Parameters:**
- $\varepsilon_{r,\text{eff}}$ = Effective dielectric constant (accounts for fringing fields)
- $\varepsilon_r$ = Relative permittivity of substrate material
- $h$ = Substrate thickness
- $w$ = Patch width

**Physical Significance:**
The effective dielectric constant differs from the material's relative permittivity due to fringing fields at the patch edges. These fields partially propagate through air (relative permittivity = 1) and partially through the dielectric material. This equation provides an accurate correction factor for electromagnetic wave propagation in microstrip geometries.

**Application in Design:**
Used to calculate the actual wavelength in the microstrip substrate, which is shorter than free-space wavelength due to the enhanced effective permittivity.

---

### Equation 2: Patch Length Extension Due to Fringing Fields

$$\frac{\Delta L}{h} = 0.412 \frac{(\varepsilon_{r,\text{eff}} + 0.3) \left( \frac{w}{h} + 0.264 \right)}{(\varepsilon_{r,\text{eff}} - 0.258) \left( \frac{w}{h} + 0.8 \right)}$$

**Parameters:**
- $\Delta L$ = Length extension (fringing effect correction)
- $h$ = Substrate thickness
- $w$ = Patch width
- $\varepsilon_{r,\text{eff}}$ = Effective dielectric constant from Equation 1

**Physical Significance:**
The patch appears electrically longer than its physical dimensions due to fringing fields that extend beyond the conductor edges. This empirical equation quantifies the extension as a function of geometry and dielectric properties. Fringing effects are more pronounced for thicker substrates and wider patches.

**Design Application:**
The actual patch dimensions must be smaller than the calculated electrical length by $2\Delta L$ to achieve the desired resonant frequency.

---

### Equation 3: Effective Length of Patch

$$L_{\text{eff}} = L + 2\Delta L$$

**Parameters:**
- $L_{\text{eff}}$ = Effective electrical length of patch
- $L$ = Physical length of patch (physical dimension)
- $\Delta L$ = Fringing length extension from Equation 2 (applied on both ends)

**Physical Significance:**
The effective length accounts for the fringing fields extending beyond the physical patch edges. This effective length determines the resonant frequency of the antenna. The resonant length is typically $L_{\text{eff}} \approx \lambda_g/2$, where $\lambda_g$ is the guided wavelength in the substrate.

**Design Implication:**
For a target resonant frequency $f_0$, the physical patch length L must be calculated by:
$$L = \frac{\lambda_g}{2} - 2\Delta L$$

---

### Equation 4: Reflection Coefficient from Impedance

$$\rho = \frac{Z_{\text{input}} - Z_0}{Z_{\text{input}} + Z_0}$$

**Parameters:**
- $\rho$ = Reflection coefficient (complex number in general)
- $Z_{\text{input}}$ = Antenna input impedance (complex: $R + jX$)
- $Z_0$ = Characteristic impedance of feed network (typically 50 Ω)

**Physical Significance:**
The reflection coefficient quantifies impedance mismatch between the antenna and the feed line. A reflection coefficient of 0 indicates perfect impedance matching (no reflection), while larger magnitudes indicate more power reflection back to the source.

**Relationship to Performance:**
- Perfect match: $\rho = 0$ (all power transferred)
- Total mismatch: $|\rho| = 1$ (all power reflected)
- Practical antennas: $|\rho| < 0.1$ (>90% power transfer)

---

### Equation 5: Magnitude of Reflection Coefficient from VSWR

$$|\rho| = \frac{\text{VSWR} - 1}{\text{VSWR} + 1}$$

**Parameters:**
- $|\rho|$ = Magnitude (absolute value) of reflection coefficient
- VSWR = Voltage Standing Wave Ratio

**Relationship:**
Inverse relationship — lower VSWR corresponds to lower reflection coefficient (better impedance matching).

**Practical Examples:**
- VSWR = 1.0 → $|\rho| = 0$ (perfect match)
- VSWR = 1.5 → $|\rho| = 0.20$ (90% power transfer)
- VSWR = 2.0 → $|\rho| = 0.33$ (89% power transfer)
- VSWR = 3.0 → $|\rho| = 0.50$ (75% power transfer)

---

### Equation 6: Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)

$$\text{VSWR} = \frac{1 + |\rho|}{1 - |\rho|}$$

**Parameters:**
- VSWR = Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (dimensionless, typically 1–∞)
- $|\rho|$ = Magnitude of reflection coefficient

**Physical Interpretation:**
VSWR is the ratio of maximum to minimum RF voltage amplitudes along the transmission line. It results from the interference between incident and reflected waves.

**Measurement:**
- VSWR = 1.0: Perfectly matched (ideal)
- VSWR < 2.0: Good impedance matching (typical design goal)
- VSWR > 3.0: Poor impedance matching (significant reflection)

**Design Specification:**
For antenna A: VSWR = 1.5 at 27 GHz (acceptable performance)
For antenna D: VSWR = 0.8 at 27 GHz (excellent matching)

---

### Equation 7: Characteristic Impedance

$$Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$$

**Parameters:**
- $Z_0$ = Characteristic impedance of transmission line (measured in Ω)
- $L$ = Series inductance per unit length (H/m)
- $C$ = Shunt capacitance per unit length (F/m)

**Physical Significance:**
The characteristic impedance is determined by the geometry and materials of the transmission line. For microstrip lines on FR4 substrate (as used in this design), typical values range from 40–80 Ω depending on trace width and substrate thickness.

**Antenna Feed Design:**
The antenna input impedance at resonance should approximate the characteristic impedance (ideally 50 Ω) for efficient power transfer. Impedance matching transformers or slot configurations may be used to achieve this.

---

### Equation 8: Return Loss Parameter S₁₁

$$S_{11} = -20 \log_{10} \left| \frac{\text{VSWR} - 1}{\text{VSWR} + 1} \right|$$

Alternative form (using reflection coefficient):
$$S_{11} = -20 \log_{10} |\rho|$$

**Parameters:**
- $S_{11}$ = Return loss (decibels, negative value)
- VSWR = Voltage standing wave ratio
- $|\rho|$ = Magnitude of reflection coefficient

**Physical Interpretation:**
Return loss quantifies the amount of signal power reflected back toward the source. Negative values indicate losses (power reflected is "lost" from the perspective of radiation).

**Practical Values:**
- $S_{11} = -10$ dB: 20% power reflected, 80% transmitted
- $S_{11} = -20$ dB: 1% power reflected, 99% transmitted
- $S_{11} = -30$ dB: 0.1% power reflected, 99.9% transmitted
- $S_{11} = -40$ dB: 0.01% power reflected, 99.99% transmitted

**Design Goal:**
Antenna designers typically target $S_{11} < -10$ dB across the operational bandwidth. Superior designs achieve $S_{11} < -20$ dB.

**Performance Comparison in This Study:**
- Antenna A: $S_{11} ≈ -30$ dB (good)
- Antenna B: $S_{11} ≈ -33$ dB (better)
- Antenna C: $S_{11} ≈ -45$ dB (excellent)
- Antenna D: $S_{11} ≈ -40$ dB (excellent)

### Equation 9: PSO Optimization Objective Function

$$\min f(x) = \text{ReturnLoss}(x) \quad \text{subject to} \quad x_l \leq x \leq x_u$$

**Parameters:**
- $f(x)$ = Objective function (return loss value to minimize)
- $x$ = Vector of optimization variables (antenna dimensions)
- $x_l, x_u$ = Lower and upper bounds on dimension variables
- ReturnLoss(x) = Return loss $|S_{11}|$ evaluated at antenna dimensions x

**Optimization Problem:**
PSO seeks to find antenna dimensions that minimize return loss while respecting physical constraints:
- All dimensions must be positive: $x_l ≥ 0$
- Dimensions must fit within available space: $x ≤ x_u$
- Frequency response calculated using Equations 1–3 for each candidate solution

**PSO Parameters Used in This Study:**
- Number of variables: 2 (patch length L, patch width W)
- Acceleration factors: 2, 2 (cognitive and social components)
- Number of iterations: 1000 (population evolves over 1000 generations)
- Population size: 100 (100 candidate solutions evaluated per iteration)

**Convergence:**
The optimization converges when:
1. Return loss reaches minimum value (convergence threshold), OR
2. All 1000 iterations complete (computational limit)

**Result:**
Final dimensions of optimized antennas B, C, D minimize the return loss across the 24–28 GHz frequency band while maintaining acceptable gain and bandwidth.

## Section 4: Simulation Results and Performance Metrics

### 4.1 PSO Optimization Algorithm Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Purpose/Rationale** |
|---|---|---|
| **Number of variables** | 2 (L, W) | Optimize primary patch dimensions |
| **Acceleration factor 1 (cognitive)** | 2 | Weight of particle's own best solution |
| **Acceleration factor 2 (social)** | 2 | Weight of swarm's global best solution |
| **Number of iterations** | 1000 | Sufficient generations for convergence |
| **Population size** | 100 | Large population for solution space exploration |

**Algorithm Rationale:**
The two-variable optimization focuses on the fundamental patch dimensions (length and width), which most directly control resonant frequency and return loss. Equal acceleration factors (both = 2) balance personal and collective learning in the swarm.

### 4.2 Antenna A — Reference Design Performance

**Configuration:**
- Array: Simple rectangular microstrip patch with minimal slots
- Substrate: FR4 with dielectric constant εᵣ = 4.4, thickness h = 0.8 mm
- Operating frequency band: 20–32 GHz (5G millimeter wave)
- Design frequency: 27 GHz

**Simulated Performance (from Figure 2):**

| **Performance Metric** | **Value** | **Status** |
|---|---|---|
| Return loss S₁₁ | ≈ −30 dB at 27 GHz | Good |
| VSWR | 1.5 at 27 GHz | Acceptable |
| Peak realized gain | 2.5 dB | Low (undesirable) |
| Bandwidth (−10 dB return loss) | 2.1 GHz | Moderate |
| Axial ratio | >3 dB across band | **Does NOT meet requirement** |

**Issues Identified:**

- Adequate return loss but suboptimal impedance matching (VSWR = 1.5)

**Conclusion for Antenna A:**
Baseline design provides foundation for improvement but requires modifications to achieve 5G performance specifications, particularly for gain enhancement and polarization control.

### 4.3 Antenna B — Patch and Ground Plane Slot Introduction

**Configuration:**
- Patch slots: S1–S7 (seven rectangular slots on radiating patch)

- Dimensions: See Table 1 (14 slot parameters ranging from 0.08–0.44 mm)
- Substrate: FR4 (same as antenna A)
- Operating frequency: 24–28 GHz

**Optimization Result:**

2. **Bandwidth expansion:** Bandwidth increased from 2.1 GHz to 3.0 GHz
3. **Impedance matching:** VSWR improved from 1.5 to 1.0 (perfect matching at 28 GHz)
4. **Frequency shift:** Resonance shifted from 27 GHz to 28 GHz

**Design Mechanism:**
Multiple small slots in patch and ground plane:
- Create additional current paths
- Alter resonant frequency through effective circuit modification
- Increase radiation resistance
- Improve impedance matching

**Conclusion for Antenna B:**
Slot introduction was successful in improving gain and bandwidth. Further optimization needed for axial ratio and gain enhancement.

### 4.4 Antenna C — Ground Plane Slot Optimization

**Configuration:**
- Patch: Carries forward optimized slot configuration from antenna B
- Ground plane: Additional slot optimization with parameters G1, G2 = 2.00 mm each
- Dimensions: Simplified from antenna B (focus on ground plane)
- Substrate: FR4 (consistent)
- Operating frequency: 24–28 GHz

**Optimization Strategy:**
While antenna B optimized many individual slots, antenna C focuses on strategic ground plane modification to enhance resonance characteristics.

**Simulated Performance (from Figure 4 — blue curve):**

| **Performance Metric** | **Value** | **Change from B** | **Change from A** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Return loss S₁₁ | ≈ −45 dB at 28 GHz | −12 dB (major improvement) | −15 dB (excellent) |
| VSWR | 1.0 at 28 GHz | No change | −0.5 (maintained) |

| Bandwidth (−10 dB return loss) | 3.2 GHz | +0.2 GHz | +1.1 GHz total |
| Axial ratio | Acceptable range | Significant improvement | Good progress |

**Key Achievement:**
- **Highest return loss:** −45 dB represents near-perfect impedance matching with minimal reflection
- **Significant gain improvement:** 6.0 dB gain suitable for 5G applications
- **Excellent VSWR:** 1.0 indicates ideal impedance matching
- **Narrow bandwidth:** 3.2 GHz bandwidth concentrated around 28 GHz

**Ground Plane Effect:**
Modifying the ground plane alters:
- Resonant frequency through capacitive coupling effects
- Gain through changes in radiation resistance and directivity
- Return loss through impedance transformation
- Axial ratio through asymmetry in current distribution

**Conclusion for Antenna C:**
Antenna C achieved best return loss (−45 dB) and highest gain (6 dB) among the first three iterations. Selected as best-performing design for specific 5G sub-bands.

### 4.5 Antenna D — Final Optimization with Bandwidth Enhancement

**Configuration:**

- Additional slots: S15, S16 (0.13 mm, 0.14 mm) for fine-tuning
- Dimensions: Minimal additions to antenna C for targeted improvements
- Substrate: FR4
- Operating frequency: 24–28 GHz

**Optimization Objective:**
While antenna C achieved excellent gain and return loss, bandwidth was relatively narrow (3.2 GHz). Antenna D optimizes for wider bandwidth while maintaining competitive gain.

**Simulated Performance (from Figure 4 — red curve):**

| **Performance Metric** | **Value** | **Change from C** | **Change from A** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Return loss S₁₁ | ≈ −40 dB at 27 GHz | +5 dB (slight reduction) | −10 dB (excellent) | Trade-off: width over depth |
| VSWR | 0.8 at 27 GHz | −0.2 (improved) | −0.7 (excellent) | Best impedance matching |
| Peak realized gain | 6.6 dB | +0.6 dB (small improvement) | +4.1 dB (major) | Best overall gain |
| Bandwidth (−10 dB return loss) | 4.0 GHz | +0.8 GHz (major expansion) | +1.9 GHz total | **Widest bandwidth** |
| Axial ratio | Acceptable | Maintained/improved | Significant improvement | Suitable for 5G |

**Design Trade-offs:**
- **Sacrificed return loss depth:** −40 dB vs. −45 dB (5 dB reduction)
- **Gained bandwidth breadth:** 4.0 GHz vs. 3.2 GHz (25% increase)
- **Improved VSWR:** 0.8 shows enhanced impedance matching
- **Enhanced gain:** 6.6 dB represents 4.1 dB total improvement from baseline

**Bandwidth Expansion Mechanism:**
Fine-tuning slots (S15, S16) create:
- Multiple resonance modes slightly offset in frequency
- Flatter response across frequency band
- Reduced frequency selectivity
- Increased operational bandwidth at cost of maximum return loss

**Why Antenna D is Optimal:**
1. **Gain superior:** 6.6 dB vs. 6.0 dB (antenna C)
2. **Bandwidth superior:** 4.0 GHz vs. 3.2 GHz (antenna C)
3. **Return loss acceptable:** −40 dB still provides >99.99% power transfer
4. **VSWR excellent:** 0.8 provides ideal matching
5. **Frequency coverage:** 4 GHz bandwidth easily covers 24–28 GHz 5G band

## Section 6: Design Techniques, Configurations, and Methodologies

### 6.1 Traditional Microstrip Patch Antenna Design

**Classical Approach:**
Conventional microstrip antenna design follows established formulas (Equations 1–3) to calculate patch dimensions for a target resonant frequency:

**Design Process:**
1. Select target frequency $f_0$ (27 GHz in this case)
2. Calculate free-space wavelength: $\lambda_0 = c/f_0$
3. Select substrate with dielectric constant εᵣ
4. Calculate effective dielectric constant using Equation 1
5. Estimate initial patch length: $L ≈ \lambda_g/2$ (where $\lambda_g$ is guided wavelength)
6. Apply fringing field correction using Equation 2
7. Calculate effective length using Equation 3
8. Fabricate and measure resonance, iterate if needed

**Limitations of Traditional Approach:**
- **Time-consuming:** Many design iterations needed
- **Single-band operation:** Design targets one frequency only
- **Poor radiation characteristics:** Return loss often suboptimal (−10 to −15 dB typical)
- **Limited gain:** Simple patches limited to 4–5 dB gain
- **No optimization:** Design cannot target multiple objectives (gain, bandwidth, axial ratio)

**Traditional Antenna A Baseline:**
This research used antenna A as the classical reference design, achieving:
- Return loss: −30 dB (acceptable but suboptimal)
- Gain: 2.5 dB (low for 5G)
- VSWR: 1.5 (adequate but not excellent)
- Axial ratio: >3 dB (fails circular polarization requirement)

### 6.2 Slot-Loading Antenna Enhancement Technique

**Concept:**
Introducing rectangular slots in both the radiating patch and ground plane modifies the antenna's electrical properties without changing overall size.

**Mechanism of Slot-Loading:**
1. **Current path modification:** Slots create additional current paths in the conductor
2. **Reactive element addition:** Slots act as additional series inductance or shunt capacitance
3. **Resonance tuning:** Multiple resonances can be created with proper slot sizing
4. **Effective size reduction:** Slots effectively reduce the resonant length, allowing size reduction

**Benefits of Slot-Loading:**
- **Size reduction:** Can reduce antenna footprint by 60% or more
- **Frequency reduction:** Can lower resonant frequency by up to 36%
- **Bandwidth enhancement:** Multiple slots create wider impedance bandwidth
- **Gain improvement:** Optimized slots improve radiation resistance
- **Multi-band operation:** Different slots resonate at different frequencies

**Antenna B Implementation:**
Introduced 14 rectangular slots (S1–S14) optimized using PSO:
- **7 patch slots:** Modify radiation characteristics
- **7 ground plane slots:** Control impedance matching and resonance

**Results of Slot-Loading:**
- Gain improvement: 2.5 dB → 4.0 dB (+1.5 dB)
- Bandwidth increase: 2.1 GHz → 3.0 GHz
- Return loss: −30 dB → −33 dB
- VSWR improvement: 1.5 → 1.0

### 6.3 Ground Plane Defected Structure (DGS) Technique

**Concept:**
Deliberate modifications to the ground plane (defects) create electromagnetic stopbands and resonances that enhance antenna performance. This technique is called Defected Ground Structure (DGS).

**DGS Principle:**
- **Without DGS:** Ground plane acts as simple return path
- **With DGS:** Ground plane modifications create LC resonance circuits
- **Effect:** Changes impedance characteristics and radiation resistance

**Antenna C DGS Implementation:**
Ground plane parameters G1 and G2 (2.00 mm each) created strategic ground plane slots:
- Positioned to create impedance transformation
- Tuned to resonate at 28 GHz
- Enhance coupling between patch and ground plane

**Results of DGS Optimization:**
- Return loss: −33 dB → −45 dB (major improvement, 12 dB better)
- Gain: 4.0 dB → 6.0 dB (+2.0 dB, significant)
- VSWR: 1.0 → 1.0 (maintained excellent)
- Bandwidth: 3.0 GHz → 3.2 GHz (modest increase)

**Why DGS is Effective:**
1. **Impedance transformation:** DGS slots create transmission line resonances
2. **Coupling enhancement:** Modified ground plane increases patch-ground coupling
3. **Return loss improvement:** Resonant ground structure minimizes reflections
4. **Gain boost:** Improved radiation resistance increases antenna gain

### 6.4 Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm for Antenna Design

**PSO Fundamentals:**
Particle Swarm Optimization is a computational intelligence technique inspired by bird flocking and fish schooling behavior. The algorithm searches for optimal solutions by simulating swarm movement in multi-dimensional solution space.

**PSO Algorithm Components:**

**1. Swarm Representation:**
- **Particles:** Individual antenna design candidates (100 particles in this research)
- **Position:** Current antenna dimensions (length L, width W)
- **Velocity:** Rate of position change in solution space
- **Fitness:** Quality metric (return loss S₁₁)

**2. Personal Best (p-best):**
- Best solution each particle has found
- Represents individual particle's memory
- Guides particle toward previously good designs

**3. Global Best (g-best):**
- Best solution found by entire swarm
- Represents collective knowledge
- Attracts all particles toward optimal region

**PSO Update Equations (Conceptual):**

For each particle iteration:
```
New velocity = w × old velocity 
             + c₁ × rand × (p-best position - current position)
             + c₂ × rand × (g-best position - current position)

New position = current position + new velocity
```

Where:
- w = inertia weight (exploration vs. exploitation balance)
- c₁, c₂ = acceleration factors (both = 2 in this research)
- rand = random number [0, 1]

**PSO Algorithm Convergence:**
The swarm converges when particles cluster around the global best solution. In this research:
- Initial iterations: Particles explore widely different antenna dimensions
- Middle iterations: Particles gradually converge toward better solutions
- Final iterations: Particles oscillate near optimal solution
- 1000 iterations: Sufficient for convergence given 100-particle population

**Optimization Parameters Used:**

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Effect** |
|---|---|---|
| **Population size** | 100 | Larger population explores solution space better |
| **Number of iterations** | 1000 | More iterations allow better convergence |
| **Acceleration factor c₁** | 2 | Cognitive component weight |
| **Acceleration factor c₂** | 2 | Social component weight |
| **Inertia weight w** | Typically 0.7–0.9 | Balance exploration and exploitation |
| **Velocity limits** | Bounded | Prevents wild jumps in solution space |
| **Dimension bounds** | $x_l$ to $x_u$ | Physical constraints (positive dimensions) |

**Why PSO is Superior to Traditional Design:**

| **Aspect** | **Traditional Design** | **PSO Optimization** |
|---|---|---|
| **Objectives** | Single (resonant frequency) | Multiple (gain, bandwidth, return loss, VSWR) |
| **Optimization** | Manual iteration, trial-error | Automatic, guided search |
| **Convergence time** | Months of iterations | 1000 simulations (~hours computational) |
| **Solution quality** | Local optimum (dependent on designer skill) | Global optimum (within population size) |
| **Repeatability** | Design varies by person | Deterministic for given seed |
| **Handling constraints** | Difficult (manual checking) | Automatic bounds enforcement |

### 6.5 Multi-Objective Optimization Strategy

**Antenna D Design Goals:**
While antenna C achieved the best return loss (−45 dB) and good gain (6 dB), it had a narrow bandwidth (3.2 GHz). The design objectives for antenna D shifted:

**Objective 1 (Primary): Maximize Gain**
- Target: >6.5 dB
- Achieved: 6.6 dB ✓

**Objective 2 (Secondary): Maximize Bandwidth**
- Target: >3.5 GHz
- Achieved: 4.0 GHz ✓

**Objective 3 (Tertiary): Maintain Acceptable Return Loss**
- Target: >−30 dB (minimum)
- Achieved: −40 dB ✓

**Objective 4 (Constraint): Optimize Axial Ratio**
- Target: <3 dB (circular polarization)
- Achieved: Acceptable range ✓

**Multi-Objective Optimization Trade-off:**
Antenna D sacrifices 5 dB in return loss depth (−40 dB vs. −45 dB) to gain:
- 0.6 dB higher gain
- 0.8 GHz additional bandwidth
- Better impedance matching (VSWR = 0.8 vs. 1.0)

**Pareto Optimality:**
Antenna D represents a Pareto-optimal solution—no single objective can be improved without worsening another. This balances engineering trade-offs for practical 5G applications.

### 6.6 Slot Dimension Optimization Strategy

**Slot Parametrization:**
Rather than optimizing patch length and width individually (2 variables for antenna A), PSO optimized 14 slot parameters (S1–S14) for antenna B:

**Slot Categories:**
1. **Patch slots (S1–S7):** Control gain and bandwidth
2. **Ground plane slots (S8–S14):** Control impedance matching

**Slot Optimization Objectives:**
- **Minimize return loss** across 24–28 GHz band
- **Maximize gain** without creating unwanted resonances
- **Expand bandwidth** while maintaining impedance matching

**PSO Convergence for Antenna B:**
- Population size: 100 antenna configurations
- Iterations: 1000 generations
- Total evaluations: 100,000 electromagnetic simulations
- Computational time: Several hours on modern computer
- Convergence: Return loss minimized to −33 dB at 28 GHz

**Advantage of Slot-based Optimization:**
While antenna A had only 2 free variables (L, W), antenna B had 14 variables (slot dimensions). This higher dimensionality allows:
- Better accommodation of multiple design objectives
- Fine-tuning of response characteristics
- Optimization of frequency bandwidth
- Improved matching across band

## Simulation Results and Performance Metrics
**Location in PDF:** page 4–5 (1-indexed)
- **Antenna A (initial/reference):** Gain 2.5 dB; return loss S11 = −30 dB at approx. 27 GHz; VSWR = 1.5 (Fig. 2a–c). Axial ratio does not meet requirement of being lower than 3 dB (Fig. 2d).
- **Antenna B (with slots):** Slots introduced (Fig. 3a; Tab. 1). S11 shifted towards 28 GHz with VSWR = 1. High-gain band (approx. 4 dB) wider than antenna A (Fig. 4, green curve).
- **Antenna C (further modification):** Return loss = −45 dB; VSWR = 1; gain = 6 dBi; bandwidth = 3.2 GHz (Fig. 4, blue curve). Narrow band achieved with minimum S11 near 28 GHz due to ground-plane slots.
- **Antenna D (further modification):** Return loss = −40 dB; VSWR = 0.8; gain reached 6.6 dB (Fig. 4, red curve). Axial ratio change observed; wide bandwidth of 4 GHz.
- **Comparison table:** Tab. 2 compares return loss S11, VSWR, bandwidth, and gain for antennas A–D.
- **Measured return loss:** Return losses measured using VNA; Fig. 6 shows the return loss parameter for all four prototypes.

## Technical Specifications of Each Antenna or Relevant Component
