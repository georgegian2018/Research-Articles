## 4. EQUATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS

### Equation 1: Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) from Far-Field Radiation

**Equation:**
```
ρₑ = |∫∫₄π [F₁(θ, φ)* · F₂(θ, φ)] dΩ|² / {∫∫₄π |F₁(θ, φ)|² dΩ · ∫∫₄π |F₂(θ, φ)|² dΩ}
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- F₁(θ, φ) = three-dimensional far-field radiation pattern of antenna element 1
- F₂(θ, φ) = three-dimensional far-field radiation pattern of antenna element 2
- * = complex conjugate operator
- · = dot product
- Ω = solid angle
- dΩ = solid angle differential element

**Application:** [file:26]
- Used to evaluate MIMO performance and channel correlation
- ECC values of single-band system: < 0.007 (excellent diversity)
- ECC values of dual-band system: < 0.317 (lower band), < 0.009 (higher band)
- Criterion: ECC should be < 0.5 for acceptable MIMO performance

---

### Equation 2: Mean Effective Gain (MEG) - Taga's Formula

**Equation:**
```
MEG = ∫₀²π ∫₀π {[XPR/(1+XPR)] × Gθ(θ, φ) × Pθ(θ, φ) + [1/(1+XPR)] × Gφ(θ, φ) × Pφ(θ, φ)} sin θ dθ dφ
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- MEG = mean effective gain (ratio of mean received power to total mean incident power)
- XPR = cross-polarization power ratio (mean incident power ratio of vertically and horizontally polarized waves)
- Gθ(θ, φ) = antenna gain component in theta direction
- Gφ(θ, φ) = antenna gain component in phi direction
- Pθ(θ, φ) = theta component of normalized angular power density function of incoming plane waves
- Pφ(θ, φ) = phi component of normalized angular power density function of incoming plane waves
- θ = elevation angle (0 to π)
- φ = azimuth angle (0 to 2π)
- sin θ dθ dφ = solid angle weighting element

**Application:** [file:26]
- MEGs of all proposed antenna elements remain stable within operational bands
- MEGs approximately satisfy equality criteria for good MIMO diversity and system power balancing
- Single-band MEG: approximately –3.5 to –4.5 dB
- Dual-band MEG: approximately –2.5 to –4.5 dB

---

### Equation 3: Diversity Gain (DG)

**Equation:**
```
G_DG = 10 × √(1 - |ρ|²)
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- G_DG = diversity gain (in dB)
- ρ = correlation coefficient (from ECC)
- |ρ|² = magnitude squared of correlation coefficient
- √(1 - |ρ|²) = diversity factor

**Application:** [file:26]
- Single-band diversity gain: > 9.96 dB
- Dual-band diversity gain: > 9.82 dB
- Higher values indicate better MIMO performance and lower antenna correlation

Fig. 3. The process of generating a modified Peano pre-fractal curve.
based on the second iteration of a modified Peano-type fractal
geometry [12]. The process of generating a modified Peano
pre-fractal curve is shown in Fig. 3.
The proposed fractal geometry is combined with a 50Ωtrans-
mission line. RF signal is fed from a coax connector to the
hole in the ground layer.
3. Performance Analysis
Figure 4 presents the results of S-parameter simulations for
the proposed single-band, four-element MIMO antenna. One
may notice that the desired single operating band of 3.445–
3.885 GHz for 5G n77 and n78 bands applications is achieved
with an acceptable impedance matching of less than –6 dB,
meaning that a 3:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) has
been achieved, as shown in Fig. 4a. As illustrated in Fig. 4b,
decent isolation better than 23 dB is achieved by applying the
self-isolated and spatial diversity methodologies, where the
four MIMO antennas are placed at the corners of the PCB.
The transmission coefficients are better than: S12 –23 dB, S13
–30 dB, S14 –37 dB (diagonal distance), S15 –26 dB, and S16
–35 dB.
Figure 5 shows the S-parameters of the dual band MIMO
antenna design proposed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the operat-
ing range of 1.684–2.300 GHz for n2, n3, n39, n65, and n66

bands, and 4.432–5.638 GHz for n79 and 5.15–5.63 GHz for
WLAN bands, works with an impedance matching score of
less than –6 dB (3:1 VSWR). From Fig. 5b, suitable isolation
of better than 16 dB in the higher band and acceptable iso-
lation better than 10 dB in the lower band is attained using
the self-isolated method, i.e., without inserting any decou-
pling parameters or/and deploying any isolation techniques,
where the four MIMO antennas are located closely to each
other, in the middle of the mobile phone’s PCB. Only the
essential transmission coefficients of the lower band are intro-
duced, which are all better than the accepted level of –10 dB.
These are as follows: the S51 ≈–14 dB, S53 ≈–19 dB, S56
≈–10 dB, S57 ≈–10 dB, and S58 ≈–13 dB. In contrast, the
transmission coefficients of the higher band are as follows:
S51 ≈–20 dB, S53 ≈–29 dB, S56 ≈–26 dB, S57 ≈–16 dB,
and S58 ≈–28 dB.
Figure 6 illustrates the efficiencies of the single-band four
MIMO antennas setup. As illustrated, radiation antenna effi-
ciency and total antenna efficiency levels that are acceptable
for mobile phone applications are obtained. The radiation and
total antenna efficiencies are between 67–82% and 50–76%,
respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, good antenna gains are
obtained, where the maximum gain in the working band is
almost 2.6 dB. The efficiencies of the four antennas of the
dual-band MIMO antenna system are shown in Fig. 8. Decent
radiation and total antenna efficiencies are attained, remain-
ing between 81–90% and 47–60%, for the lower band. For
the higher band, the scores of between 79–87% and 56–84%
are obtained. High antenna gains

fficiencies of the single-band four
MIMO antennas setup. As illustrated, radiation antenna effi-
ciency and total antenna efficiency levels that are acceptable
for mobile phone applications are obtained. The radiation and
total antenna efficiencies are between 67–82% and 50–76%,
respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, good antenna gains are

ing between 81–90% and 47–60%, for the lower band. For
the higher band, the scores of between 79–87% and 56–84%
are obtained. High antenna gains can be also observed in Fig.
9, with the maximum gain that can be reached in the lower
operating band equaling approximately 3.5 dB, and approxi-
mately 4.3 dB in the higher operating band.
For clarity and due to the similarity of results, one-sided anten-
nas (ant. 1, 3, 5, and ant. 6) are considered. Figure 10 presents
two-dimensional radiation patterns at the working bands,
while Fig. 11 depicts, for comparison, three-dimensional
radiation patterns. As shown in the pictures, each antenna el-
ement has a maximum gain direction that differs from the
maximum gain orientations of the other antennas, suggesting
decent pattern diversity characteristics. Furthermore, each
antenna’s radiation pattern covers both sides of the mobile
device PCB board. As a result, the proposed MIMO antenna
systems achieve the expected level of radiation coverage.

based on the second iteration of a modified Peano-type fractal

pre-fractal curve is shown in Fig. 3.
The proposed fractal geometry is combined with a 50Ωtrans-
mission line. RF signal is fed from a coax connector to the
hole in the ground layer.
3. Performance Analysis
Figure 4 presents the results of S-parameter simulations for
the proposed single-band, four-element MIMO antenna. One
may notice that the desired single operating band of 3.445–
3.885 GHz for 5G n77 and n78 bands applications is achieved
with an acceptable impedance matching of less than –6 dB,
meaning that a 3:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) has
been achieved, as shown in Fig. 4a. As illustrated in Fig. 4b,
decent isolation better than 23 dB is achieved by applying the
self-isolated and spatial diversity methodologies, where the
four MIMO antennas are placed at the corners of the PCB.
The transmission coefficients are better than: S12 –23 dB, S13
–30 dB, S14 –37 dB (diagonal distance), S15 –26 dB, and S16
–35 dB.
Figure 5 shows the S-parameters of the dual band MIMO
antenna design proposed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the operat-

four antennas are positioned in the middle of the terminal board,
supports two wide bands of 1.684–2.300 GHz and 4.432–5.638

1. Introduction
The constantly increasing data transmission rates and the
advent of smart services motivate researchers to develop
wireless communication techniques. This leads to the need
of an antenna system that can simultaneously operate with
different frequencies, providing high data rates, good quality
of service, and very low latency [1], [2]. The 5G technolo-
gy and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recognized as the key
trends capable of transforming education, industry, health-
care, and other public areas in the future [3].
The MIMO antenna technology is utilized for 5G mobile
terminals to enhance spectrum efficiency and channel capaci-
ty [4], [5]. However, an increase in the number of antennas
creates integration issues due to the constrained space avail-
able in mobile devices [6], [7]. Many techniques have been
used to deal with this problem, including the multimode
decoupling method [8] and the hybrid decoupling method
(neutralization line and ground slot) [9]. Nevertheless, anten-
na efficiency was significantly reduced because of additional
isolation-related components.
The self-isolated approach has been revealed to provide high
isolation and antenna efficiency [10], [11]. However, such
antenna systems operate in a single band only. As a result,

bands, and 4.432–5.638 GHz for n79 and 5.15–5.63 GHz for
WLAN bands, works with an impedance matching score of
less than –6 dB (3:1 VSWR). From Fig. 5b, suitable isolation
of better than 16 dB in the higher band and acceptable iso-
lation better than 10 dB in the lower band is attained using
the self-isolated method, i.e., without inserting any decou-
pling parameters or/and deploying any isolation techniques,
where the four MIMO antennas are located closely to each
other, in the middle of the mobile phone’s PCB. Only the
essential transmission coefficients of the lower band are intro-
duced, which are all better than the accepted level of –10 dB.
These are as follows: the S51 ≈–14 dB, S53 ≈–19 dB, S56
≈–10 dB, S57 ≈–10 dB, and S58 ≈–13 dB. In contrast, the
transmission coefficients of the higher band are as follows:
S51 ≈–20 dB, S53 ≈–29 dB, S56 ≈–26 dB, S57 ≈–16 dB,
and S58 ≈–28 dB.
Figure 6 illustrates the efficiencies of the single-band four
MIMO antennas setup. As illustrated, radiation antenna effi-
ciency and total antenna efficiency levels that are acceptable
for mobile phone applications are obtained. The radiation and
total antenna efficiencies are between 67–82% and 50–76%,
respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, good antenna gains are
obtained, where the maximum gain in the working band is
almost 2.6 dB. The efficiencies of the four antennas of the
dual-band MIMO antenna system are shown in Fig. 8. Decent
radiation and total antenna efficiencies are attained, remain-
ing between 81–90% and 47–60%, for the lower band. For
the higher band, the scores of between 79–87% and 56–84%
are obtained. High antenna gains can be also observed in Fig.
9, with the maximum gain that can be reached in the lower
operating band equaling approximately 3.5 dB, and approxi-

For clarity and due to the similarity of results, one-sided anten-
nas (ant. 1, 3, 5, and ant. 6) are considered. Figure 10 presents
two-dimensional radiation patterns at the working bands,
while Fig. 11 depicts, for comparison, three-dimensional
radiation patterns. As shown in the pictures, each antenna el-
ement has a maximum gain direction that differs from the
maximum gain orientations of the other antennas, suggesting
decent pattern diversity characteristics. Furthermore, each
antenna’s radiation pattern covers both sides of the mobile
device PCB board. As a result, the proposed MIMO antenna
systems achieve the expected level of radiation coverage.

different frequencies, providing high data rates, good quality
of service, and very low latency [1], [2]. The 5G technolo-
gy and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recognized as the key
trends capable of transforming education, industry, health-
care, and other public areas in the future [3].
The MIMO antenna technology is utilized for 5G mobile
terminals to enhance spectrum efficiency and channel capaci-
ty [4], [5]. However, an increase in the number of antennas
creates integration issues due to the constrained space avail-
able in mobile devices [6], [7]. Many techniques have been
used to deal with this problem, including the multimode
decoupling method [8] and the hybrid decoupling method
(neutralization line and ground slot) [9]. Nevertheless, anten-
na efficiency was significantly reduced because of additional
isolation-related components.
The self-isolated approach has been revealed to provide high
isolation and antenna efficiency [10], [11]. However, such
antenna systems operate in a single band only. As a result,
developing a small, multi-band MIMO antenna with good
performance and a high isolation rate has become a signifi-
cant challenge.
A compact dual-functional antenna array is presented in this
study for use in multi-band MIMO applications in mobile
devices supporting 5G. Adequate isolation is accomplished
without inserting any decoupling

The proposed fractal geometry is combined with a 50Ωtrans-
mission line. RF signal is fed from a coax connector to the
hole in the ground layer.
3. Performance Analysis
Figure 4 presents the results of S-parameter simulations for
the proposed single-band, four-element MIMO antenna. One
may notice that the desired single operating band of 3.445–
3.885 GHz for 5G n77 and n78 bands applications is achieved
with an acceptable impedance matching of less than –6 dB,
meaning that a 3:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) has
been achieved, as shown in Fig. 4a. As illustrated in Fig. 4b,
decent isolation better than 23 dB is achieved by applying the
self-isolated and spatial diversity methodologies, where the
four MIMO antennas are placed at the corners of the PCB.
The transmission coefficients are better than: S12 –23 dB, S13
–30 dB, S14 –37 dB (diagonal distance), S15 –26 dB, and S16
–35 dB.
Figure 5 shows the S-parameters of the dual band MIMO
antenna design proposed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the operat-

Abstract This article introduces a dual-functional low-profile
compact multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna array
for multi-band communication in 5G smartphones. The pro-
posed eight elements of the antenna array form two different 4×4
MIMO systems. The first four elements are placed at the four
mobile corners and operate in a single band of 3.445–3.885 GHz
for 5G n77 and n78 applications. The other system, in which
four antennas are positioned in the middle of the terminal board,
supports two wide bands of 1.684–2.300 GHz and 4.432–5.638
for n2, n3, n39, n65, n66, n79, and WLAN applications. The sec-
ond iteration of a modified Peano-type fractal geometry served
as the design foundation for the proposed antenna element. The
system’s ground plane design is based on self-isolated and spa-
tial diversity methods. The single-band MIMO system’s isolation
is better than 23 dB. In the dual-band MIMO system that is
based on self-isolation, isolation equals approximately 16 dB
in the higher band and 10 dB in the lower band. To evaluate
performance, radiation-related and total antenna efficiencies,
scattering parameters and gains were investigated. Additionally,
ECCs have been considered to evaluate MIMO performance. Ac-
cording to the results, such design constitutes a valuable option
for MIMO applications in 5G smartphones.

the proposed single-band, four-element MIMO antenna. One
may notice that the desired single operating band of 3.445–
3.885 GHz for 5G n77 and n78 bands applications is achieved
with an acceptable impedance matching of less than –6 dB,
meaning that a 3:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) has
been achieved, as shown in Fig. 4a. As illustrated in Fig. 4b,
decent isolation better than 23 dB is achieved by applying the
self-isolated and spatial diversity methodologies, where the
four MIMO antennas are placed at the corners of the PCB.
The transmission coefficients are better than: S12 –23 dB, S13
–30 dB, S14 –37 dB (diagonal distance), S15 –26 dB, and S16
–35 dB.

ultiple output (MIMO) antenna array
for multi-band communication in 5G smartphones. The pro-
posed eight elements of the antenna array form two different 4×4
MIMO systems. The first four elements are placed at the four
mobile corners and operate in a single band of 3.445–3.885 GHz
for 5G n77 and n78 applications. The other system, in which
four antennas are positioned in the middle of the terminal board,
supports two wide bands of 1.684–2.300 GHz and 4.432–5.638
for n2, n3, n39, n65, n66, n79, and WLAN applications. The sec-
ond iteration of a modified Peano-type fractal geometry served
as the design foundation for the proposed antenna element. The
system’s ground plane design is based on self-isolated and spa-
tial diversity methods. The single-band MIMO system’s isolation
is better than 23 dB. In the dual-band MIMO system that is
based on self-isolation, isolation equals approximately 16 dB
in the higher band and 10 dB in the lower band. To evaluate
performance, radiation-related and total antenna efficiencies,
scattering parameters and gains were investigated. Additionally,
ECCs have been considered to evaluate MIMO performance. Ac-
cording to the results, such design constitutes a valuable option
for MIMO applications in 5G smartphones.

1. Introduction
The constantly increasing data transmission rates and the
advent of smart services motivate researchers to develop
wireless communication techniques. This leads to the need
of an antenna system that can simultaneously operate with
different frequencies, providing high data rates, good quality
of service, and very low latency [1], [2]. The 5G technolo-
gy and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recognized as the key
trends capable of transforming education, industry, health-
care, and other public areas in the future [3].
The MIMO antenna technology is utilized for 5G mobile
terminals to enhance spectrum efficiency and channel capaci-
ty [4], [5]. However, an increase in the number of antennas
creates integration issues due to the constrained space avail-
able in mobile devices [6], [7]. Many techniques have been
used to deal with this problem, including the multimode
decoupling method [8] and the hybrid decoupling method
(neutralization line and ground slot) [9]. Nevertheless, anten-
na efficiency was significantly reduced because of additional
iso

2. Proposed Antenna Array
The design of an eight-element dual MIMO antenna array
for 5G handset applications is shown in Fig. 1. The antenna
array comprises two different 4×4 MIMO systems. The four
antennas (ant. 1–4) in the corners of the main PCB are relied
upon to build a MIMO system which can operate in a single
3.445–3.885 GHz band, as part of the 5G n77 and n78 NR
(new radio) bands. The other four MIMO elements (ant. 5–8)
are placed in the middle of the PCB and support wide bands
of 1.684–2.300 GHz for n2, n3, n39, n65, n66 4.432–5.638
GHz for n79, and 5.15-5.63 GHz WLAN.
All eight antenna elements are located on the top layer made
of a 0.8 mm thick double-sided FR4 substrate with a relative
permittivity of 4.3 and a loss tangent of 0.02, as shown in
Fig. 1a. The thickness of the conductive layer is 35 µm. The
system’s circuit board has the size of 150×75 mm – a stan-
dard dimension for mobile phones. The ground bottom layer
enhances the antenna’s impedance matching and bandwidth,
as shown in Fig. 1b. However, in the proposed design, the
ground layer is slightly modified to achieve two different 4×4
MIMO systems. Figure 2 presents the design of a single com-
pact monopole antenna element with its dimensions being

bands, and 4.432–5.638 GHz for n79 and 5.15–5.63 GHz for
WLAN bands, works with an impedance matching score of
less than –6 dB (3:1 VSWR). From Fig. 5b, suitable isolation
of better than 16 dB in the higher band and acceptable iso-
lation better than 10 dB in the lower band is attained using
the self-isolated method, i.e., without inserting any decou-
pling parameters or/and deploying any isolation techniques,
where the four MIMO antennas are located closely to each
other, in the middle of the mobile phone’s PCB. Only the
essential transmission coefficients of the lower band are intro-
duced, which are all better than the accepted level of –10 dB.
These are as follows: the S51 ≈–14 dB, S53 ≈–19 dB, S56
≈–10 dB, S57 ≈–10 dB, and S58 ≈–13 dB. In contrast, the
transmission coefficients of the higher band are as follows:
S51 ≈–20 dB, S53 ≈–29 dB, S56 ≈–26 dB, S57 ≈–16 dB,
and S58 ≈–28 dB.
Figure 6 illustrates the efficiencies of the single-band four
MIMO antennas setup. As illustrated, radiation antenna effi-
ciency and total antenna efficiency levels that are acceptable
for mobile phone applications are obtained. The radiation and
total antenna efficiencies are between 67–82% and 50–76%,
respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, good antenna gains are
obtained, where the maximum gain in the working band is
almost 2.6 dB. The efficiencies of the four antennas of the
dual-band MIMO antenna system are shown in Fig. 8. Decent
radiation and total antenna efficiencies are attained, remain-
ing between 81–90% and 47–60%, for the lower band. For
the higher band, the scores of between 79–87% and 56–84%
are obtained. High antenna gains can be also observed in Fig.
9, with the maximum gain that can be reached in the lower
operating band equaling approximately 3.5 dB, and approxi-
mately 4.3 dB in the higher operating band.
For clarity and due to the similarity of results, one-sided anten-
nas (ant. 1, 3, 5, and ant. 6) are considered. Figure 10 presents
two-dimensional radiation patterns at the working bands,
while Fig. 11 depicts, for comparison, three-dimensional
radiation patterns. As shown in the pictures, each antenna el-
ement has a maximum gain direction that differs from the
maximum gain orientations of the other antennas, suggesting
decent pattern diversity characteristics. Furthermore, each
antenna’s radiation pattern covers both sides of the mobile
device PCB board. As a result, the proposed MIMO antenna
systems achieve the expected level of radiation coverage.

shown in Fig. 13, all the ECCs are lower than 0.317 within
the lower working band, while the ECCs of the higher band
are below 0.009. Thus, the proposed four-element MIMO an-
tenna offers outstanding diversity performance due to its low
ECC values.
One of the effective performance criteria for MIMO systems
is the mean effective gain (MEG), defined as the ratio between
the mean received power of the antenna and the total mean in-
cident power [17]. MEG can be calculated using Taga’s [18]
formula:
MEG =

sin θ dθ dϕ .

The cross-polarization power ratio (XPR) is the mean incident
power ratio of vertically and horizontally polarized waves.
Pθ and Pϕ represent the theta and phi components of the
normalized angular power density functions of the incoming
plane waves, respectively. In contrast, Gθ and Gϕ represent
the antenna gain components. It is worth noting that the MEGs
of the MIMO antennas should be close to equal to ensure
good MIMO system diversity performance and system power
balancing [19].
Figure 14 illustrates the MEG of the proposed single-band
and dual-band MIMO antenna systems. The MEGs for all
antennas of the proposed single-band and dual-band antenna
systems are stable within the operational bands. Furthermore,
in the MIMO system, the MEGs approximately satisfy the
equality criteria applicable to antenna elements.
The diversity gain of the proposed single-band and dual-band
MIMO antenna systems can be estimated with the use of
a formula relative to the correlation coefficient GDG [20],
[21], such as:
GDG = 10 ×
p
1 −|ρ|2 ,

High-diversity gain performance of the single-band and dual-
band MIMO antenna system is shown in Fig. 15. It is better
than 9.96 dB in the single-band antenna system and better
than 9.82 dB in the dual-band antenna system.

4. Comparison with Other Works
Table 1 compares the performance of the proposed single-
band and dual-band MIMO antenna systems with that of
other recent MIMO antenna systems developed for 5G mobile
terminals. As shown, the proposed solution offers a compact
size antenna element, expected isolation, and adequate total
antenna efficiencies thanks to employing spatial diversity and
self-isolated methodology for the single-band antenna system
and self-isolated technique for the dual-band antenna system.
Therefore, no antenna efficiency losses are caused by other
isolation elements and/or decoupling techniques.

## 1. ABSTRACT

The paper addresses the problem of element location overlap in non-uniformly spaced antenna arrays, which occurs during optimization of element locations but is impractical to implement due to physical antenna element sizes. Two approaches based on genetic algorithm are proposed to optimize non-uniformly spaced arrays while preventing overlaps and preserving array directivity.

Key findings:
- Probability of element overlapping reduced to zero under specific conditions
- Peak sidelobe levels maintained below 15 dB
- Directivity preserved at levels comparable to standard uniformly spaced arrays
- Significantly reduced computational time compared to conventional methods

**Context:** Demonstrates the overlap problem in non-uniformly spaced arrays with optimized element locations. Shows 40-element symmetric phased array with steered beam direction uo = 0.6 radians in u-space. Multiple elements overlapped in regions, making the design practically impossible to implement without modification.

**Key observations:**
- Uniform element locations vs. optimized element locations comparison
- 2–4 elements overlapped in various regions
- Iterations shown from 0 to 10
- Element location range: 0.25 to 10.25 wavelengths
- Instability shown with iterations up to 140

- Element locations maintained between 0.25 and 10.25 wavelengths
- Still shows some residual overlaps (2 elements) due to wider bound constraints
- Iterations up to 120 shown

### Figure 3: Bound Constraints Approach
**Caption:** The bound constraints approach: (a) element locations and (b) instantaneous element locations
**Context:** Second proposed solution with individual bound constraints on each element location. Prevents element overlaps completely while preserving all degrees of freedom for pattern optimization.

**Implementation details:**
- Enforced bounds on each element location: x^uniform_n - ε ≤ x_n ≤ x^uniform_n + ε
- User-specified bound constraint margin (ε)
- Element locations: 0.25 to 10.25 wavelengths
- Iterations shown from 0 to 120
- Zero overlapping achieved in optimized result
- Bounded intervals clearly marked in visualization

AP(u) = EP(u) × AF(u) = Σ(n=1 to N/2) aₙ cos[k(xₙu - uₒ)]
```

- **EP(u)** = Element pattern (equals 1 for isotropic radiators)
- **AF(u)** = Array factor
- **aₙ** = Complex amplitude and phase weighting of n-th element

---

### EQUATION 2: Inter-element Spacing Formulation

**Formulation:**
```
For minimum spacing: dₘᵢₙ ≤ dₙ ≤ dₘₐₓ
Normalized: dₙ ≥ d̄ (minimum normalized spacing)
```

**Element location bounds:**
```
d̄/2 ≤ xₙ ≤ LUAA
```

**Where:**
- **dₙ** = Spacing between consecutive elements n and n+1
- **d̄** = Normalized minimum element spacing
- **LUAA** = Aperture length of standard uniformly spaced array
- **First element location:** x₁ = d̄/2 (fixed)
- **Last element location:** xₙ/₂ = LUAA (fixed)
- **Inner elements:** x₁ < xₙ < xₙ/₂ (optimized or constrained)

---

### EQUATION 3: Cost Function for Optimization

**Formulation:**
```
Cost = -20 log₁₀|min AP(u)|  [u ≠ uₒ]
       for u in sidelobe region: FNBW ≤ |u - uₒ| ≤ 1
```

**Where:**
- **Cost** = Objective function to minimize (in dB)
- **AP(u)** = Array pattern magnitude
- **FNBW** = First null beam width
- **uₒ** = Steering direction
- **Goal:** Minimize peak sidelobe level

**Optimization goal:** Reduce peak sidelobe level (SLL) while maintaining directivity

---

### EQUATION 4: Location Bounds Constraint (Partially Controlled Approach)

**Formulation:**
```
d̄/2 ≤ xₙ ≤ LUAA
```

**With fixed inner elements:**
```
xₙ = x^uniform_n  (for n = 1, 2, ..., N/2)  [fixed]
xₙ ≠ x^uniform_n  (for n = outer elements)  [optimized]
```

**Where:**

- **xₙ** = Optimized position bounded around reference
- **Effect:** Prevents element overlaps by enforcing spacing

**Condition for no overlaps:**

## 6. DESIGN TECHNIQUES, CONFIGURATIONS, AND METHODOLOGIES

### 6.1 Mechanical vs. Electronic Approaches

- **Method:** Fix element locations, vary amplitude and phase weighting
- **Pros:** Established method, many RF components available
- **Cons:** Sensitive to errors, requires expensive precise components, high cost, complex feeding network
- **Sensitivity:** Any deviation in amplitude/phase weighting causes pattern degradation

**Mechanical Approaches:**
- **Method:** Vary element locations, use uniform amplitude excitation
- **Pros:** Simple feeding divider network, no attenuators/amplifiers needed, robust to component errors, lower cost
- **Cons:** Physical implementation constraints (element size, mechanical positioning)
- **Preferred for:** Low-cost, robust systems

---

### 6.2 Problem of Element Location Overlaps

**Definition:** When optimizing element locations in non-uniformly spaced arrays, some elements may be placed at identical or nearly identical positions, making physical implementation impossible.

**Causes:**
- Random element location assignments during optimization
- Wide bound constraints allowing free element movement
- Multiple degrees of freedom in optimization
- Steered beam causing different optimization patterns

**Consequences:**
- Design becomes impractical to implement
- Array performance degradation if overlapping elements are omitted
- Reduction in effective number of radiating elements
- Loss of desired array pattern characteristics

**Manifestation:**
- Occurs during genetic algorithm iterations
- More prevalent with:
  - Full element control (all locations optimized)
  - Steered beams (uo ≠ 0)
  - Multiple user-defined constraints

---

### 6.3 Proposed Solution 1: Partially Controlled Element Locations

**Principle:**
Limit optimization to only outer (edge) elements while keeping inner elements fixed at uniform spacing positions.

**Implementation:**
1. Identify inner elements (center of array) – keep at x^uniform_n
2. Identify outer elements (edges) – allow optimization within bounds
3. Number of controlled elements: varies (full, half, quarter options studied)
4. Wide bounds: d̄/2 ≤ xₙ ≤ LUAA (Equation 4)

**Advantages:**
- Reduces search space significantly
- Computational time reduced (2.27–5.5 seconds vs. 7.875 seconds)
- Still achieves good sidelobe reduction (15.2–15.5 dB)
- Directivity improvement possible (up to 28.0 dB)
- Fewer optimization iterations needed

**Disadvantages:**
- Some residual element overlaps possible with wide bounds
- Reduced optimization freedom
- Slightly higher sidelobe levels than full control (15.5 dB vs. 18.6 dB baseline, but directivity improved)

**Variations Studied:**
- Full element control (all 20 optimized): D = 27.2 dB, SLL = 18.6 dB, T = 7.875 s
- Half element control (10 optimized): D = 27.3 dB, SLL = 15.5 dB, T = 5.471 s
- Quarter element control (5 optimized): D = 28.0 dB, SLL = 15.2 dB, T = 2.27 s

---

### 6.4 Proposed Solution 2: Bound Constraints on Element Locations

**Principle:**
Enforce individual minimum and maximum location bounds on every element to prevent overlaps while maintaining optimization capability.

**Implementation:**
```
Constraint: x^uniform_n - ε ≤ xₙ ≤ x^uniform_n + ε
```

**Key Features:**
- Bounds applied to all controlled elements
- User-specified margin (ε) determines constraint tightness
- Prevents overlaps by enforcing minimum spacing: xₙ - xₙ₋₁ ≥ dₘᵢₙ
- Compatible with both full and partial control strategies

**Advantages:**
- Completely eliminates element overlaps (zero probability)
- Maintains full optimization degrees of freedom (when fully controlled)
- Acceptable performance maintained (D ≈ 27.7 dB, SLL ≈ 16.0–17.0 dB)
- Practical implementation guaranteed
- Directed at keeping beamwidth and directivity close to uniform arrays

**Disadvantages:**
- Increased computational time (9.2 seconds for full control)
- Reduced sidelobe level compared to unconstrained optimization (17.0 dB vs. 18.6 dB)
- Requires careful selection of ε parameter

**Results with Bound Constraints:**

| Configuration | D (dB) | SLL (dB) | Time (s) | Overlaps |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Full + bounds | 27.74 | 17.0 | 9.2 | Zero |
| Half + bounds | 27.66 | 16.0 | 5.1 | Zero |

```

### 7.2 Sidelobe Level vs. Controlled Element Locations (Figure 4a)

**Performance Trend:**
```
Number of Controlled Locations | SLL (dB) | Trend
0 (uniform reference)           | ~20     | Baseline
5 (quarter)                     | 15.2    | Sharp reduction
10 (half)                       | 15.5    | Slight increase
20 (full)                       | 18.6    | Further increase
```

**Key observations:**
- SLL reduces significantly with partial control (15.2 dB, quarter control)
- SLL increases again with more controlled elements (back to 18.6 dB, full control)
- Minimum SLL achieved at quarter control (15.2 dB)
- Trade-off: More control allows optimization but increases SLL slightly

---

### 7.3 Directivity vs. Controlled Element Locations (Figure 4a)

**Performance Range:**
- Minimum directivity: ~22 dB (with many controlled elements)
- Maximum directivity: ~29 dB (with few controlled elements)
- Range span: 7 dB variation

**Specific values:**
- Full control (20 elements): D = 27.2 dB
- Half control (10 elements): D = 27.3 dB
- Quarter control (5 elements): D = 28.0 dB

**Trend:** Directivity slightly improves with fewer controlled elements, presumably because less degrees of freedom prevent pattern degradation.

---

### 7.4 Computational Time vs. Controlled Element Locations (Figure 4b)

**Performance Range:**
- Minimum time: ~2.27 seconds (quarter control)
- Maximum time: ~9.2 seconds (full control with bounds)
- Reduction factor: ~4× speedup

**Computational time scaling:**
- Quarter control: 2.27 s
- Half control: 5.1–5.471 s
- Full control: 7.875–9.2 s

**Implication:** Partially controlled approach significantly reduces computational burden, enabling faster design iterations.

**Performance by control strategy:**
- **Full control:** SLL ≈ 15–18 dB across scan range
- **Half control:** SLL ≈ 14–16 dB (relatively stable)
- **Quarter control:** SLL ≈ 15–17 dB (slightly variable)

**Conclusion:** SLL performance remains acceptable across wide scan angle range.

---

### 7.6 Directivity vs. Scan Angle (Figure 5b)

**Beam steering capability:**
- Scan angle range: -0.5 to +0.5 radians
- Directivity range: 20–30 dB

**Directivity variation by strategy:**
- **Full control:** D ≈ 27–28 dB (relatively flat)
- **Half control:** D ≈ 26–29 dB (more variation)
- **Quarter control:** D ≈ 25–29 dB (widest range)

**Observation:** Directivity remains above 25 dB for all strategies across scan range.

ABSTRACT
================================================================================

The paper addresses the critical problem of element location overlap in 
non-uniformly spaced antenna arrays, which occurs during optimization of element 
locations but is practically impossible to implement due to physical antenna 
element sizes. Two efficient approaches based on genetic algorithm are proposed 
to optimize non-uniformly spaced arrays while simultaneously preventing overlaps 
and preserving array directivity.

Key Findings:
- Probability of element overlapping reduced to zero under specific conditions
- Peak sidelobe levels maintained below 15 dB in optimized designs
- Directivity preserved at levels comparable to standard uniformly spaced arrays
- Computational time significantly reduced (up to 4× speedup)
- Solutions verified through comprehensive simulation studies

            (b) instantaneous element locations
   
   Context: Demonstrates the fundamental overlap problem in non-uniformly spaced 
   arrays with completely optimized element locations. Configuration: 40-element 
   symmetric phased array with steered beam direction uo = 0.6 radians in u-space.
   
   Key Observations:
   - Uniform element locations vs. optimized element locations comparison shown
   - Multiple elements overlapped in various regions (2-4 elements)
   - Element location range: 0.25 to 10.25 wavelengths
   - Iterations tracked up to 140 cycles
   - Conclusion: Without constraints, standard optimization methods produce 
     impractical designs with element overlaps

            and (b) instantaneous element locations
   
   Context: First proposed solution showing fixed inner elements and optimized 
   outer elements. This approach reduces probability of overlap while maintaining 
   directivity and keeping computational cost manageable.
   
   Design Features:
   - Inner elements: Remain fixed at uniform spacing positions
   - Outer elements: Optimized for sidelobe reduction
   - Bound constraints: Applied to outer elements only

   - User-specified margin parameter: ε (determines constraint tightness)
   - Element location range: 0.25 to 10.25 wavelengths

For minimum spacing: dₘᵢₙ ≤ dₙ ≤ dₘₐₓ
Normalized: dₙ ≥ d̄ (minimum normalized element spacing)

Element location bounds:
d̄/2 ≤ xₙ ≤ LUAA

Where:
- dₙ = Spacing between consecutive elements n and n+1
- d̄ = Normalized minimum element spacing (typically 0.5λ for half-wavelength)
- LUAA = Aperture length of standard uniformly spaced array = 9.75λ (for N=40, d=0.5λ)
- First element location (FIXED): x₁ = d̄/2 = 0.25λ
- Last element location (FIXED): xₙ/₂ = LUAA = 9.75λ
- Inner elements: x₁ < xₙ < xₙ/₂ (can be optimized or constrained)

Physical Interpretation: Defines valid search space for element locations while
maintaining overall aperture length for desired beamwidth and directivity.

EQUATION 3: Cost Function for Sidelobe Level Optimization

Mathematical Expression:
Cost = -20 log₁₀|min AP(u)|     [computed for u ≠ uₒ]
       for u in sidelobe region: FNBW ≤ |u - uₒ| ≤ 1

Where:
- Cost = Objective function to minimize (in dB)
- |AP(u)| = Magnitude of array pattern
- min(·) = Minimum operation over sidelobe region
- FNBW = First null beam width (defines sidelobe region start)
- uₒ = Main beam steering direction
- -20 log₁₀(·) = Conversion to dB scale

Optimization goal: Reduce peak sidelobe level (SLL) while maintaining
directivity and beam characteristics.

Note: Negative sign ensures minimization of sidelobe peaks (lower magnitude
becomes larger negative value in dB).

---

EQUATION 4: Location Bounds Constraint (Partially Controlled Approach)

Mathematical Expression:
d̄/2 ≤ xₙ ≤ LUAA     [applies to all elements]

With fixed inner elements:
xₙ = xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ        (for n = 1, 2, ..., N/4)     [FIXED]
xₙ ≠ xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ        (for n = outer elements)     [OPTIMIZED]

Where:
- xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ = Location of n-th element in standard uniformly spaced array
- LUAA = Standard array aperture length (9.75λ)
- Inner elements maintain uniform spacing (0.5λ)
- Outer elements optimized within wide bounds

Design Philosophy: Reduces search space and computational burden by fixing
predictable inner elements while allowing optimization of outer elements
that contribute most to sidelobe control.

---

EQUATION 5: Individual Bound Constraints (Fully Constrained Approach)

Mathematical Expression:
xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ - ε ≤ xₙ ≤ xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ + ε     [n = 1, 2, ..., N/2]

Where:
- ε = User-specified bound constraint margin
- xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ = Reference position from uniform array
- xₙ = Optimized position bounded around reference
- Upper bound: xₙ ≤ xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ + ε
- Lower bound: xₙ ≥ xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ - ε

Condition for preventing overlaps:
xₙ - xₙ₋₁ ≥ dₘᵢₙ     [for all n = 2, 3, ..., N/2]

Where dₘᵢₙ is minimum physical element spacing.

Key Feature: ε parameter chosen to enforce dₘᵢₙ spacing while allowing
sufficient optimization freedom.

Effect: Prevents element overlaps completely by ensuring each element
maintains minimum spacing from neighbors.

---

EQUATION 6: Directivity Definition for Linear Arrays

Mathematical Expression:
D = 4π × Uₘₐₓ / P_total     [linear form]
D[dB] = 10 log₁₀(D)         [logarithmic form]

Simplified for linear array:
D ≈ 2N / FNBWᵣₐd

Where:
- D = Directivity (dimensionless in linear form, dB in logarithmic form)
- Uₘₐₓ = Maximum radiation intensity
- P_total = Total radiated power
- N = Number of array elements
- FNBWᵣₐd = First null beam width in radians

For typical 40-element uniform array: D ≈ 28.3 dB

Optimization Target: Maintain directivity close to uniform array while
reducing sidelobe level through element location optimization.

---

EQUATION 7: Array Factor in Terms of Inter-element Spacing

Mathematical Expression (Alternative):
AF(u) = Σ(n=1 to N/2) aₙ cos[(n - 0.5)kdₙu]

Relationship between element location and spacing:
xₙ = Σ(i=1 to n-1) dᵢ     [cumulative spacing]

Where:
- dₙ = Inter-element spacing between elements n and n+1
- k = 2π/λ
- The sum relationship shows element locations are cumulative sum of spacings

This formulation allows optimization in spacing domain instead of location
domain, providing alternative optimization approach.

5. DESIGN TECHNIQUES, CONFIGURATIONS, AND METHODOLOGIES
================================================================================

5.2 THE ELEMENT LOCATION OVERLAP PROBLEM

Problem Definition:
When optimizing element locations in non-uniformly spaced arrays, the optimization
algorithm may place elements at identical or nearly identical positions, making
physical implementation impossible.

Physical Constraint:
Real antenna elements have finite physical size (width, diameter). Two elements
cannot occupy the same physical location. Minimum spacing dₘᵢₙ ≥ element_width.

Root Causes:
   1. Random element location assignments during genetic algorithm iterations
   2. Wide bound constraints allowing free element movement
   3. Multiple degrees of freedom in optimization process
   4. Steered beam causing asymmetric optimization patterns
   5. No explicit overlap constraints in cost function

Consequences of Overlaps:
   1. Design becomes impractical to physically implement
   2. If overlapping elements omitted: Array performance degradation
   3. Loss of effective radiating elements (fewer than N elements)
   4. Desired radiation pattern characteristics lost
   5. Directivity reduction from missing elements
   6. Sidelobe performance degradation
   7. Design must be abandoned or modified

Manifestation Pattern:
   - Occurs during genetic algorithm iterations
   - Becomes more prevalent with:
     * Full element control (all locations optimized)
     * Steered beams (uo ≠ 0) vs. broadside (uo = 0)
     * Multiple user-defined constraints
     * Tighter sidelobe level targets
   
Example from Paper:
   - 40-element array optimization
   - Target: Minimize sidelobe level while steering beam to uo = 0.6
   - Result: 2–4 elements overlapped in optimized configuration
   - Conclusion: Standard optimization fails for practical implementation

Severity Assessment:
   - Partial overlap (0.1λ spacing): Difficult to implement
   - Complete overlap (0.001λ): Impossible to implement
   - Number affected: Can range from 1–2 elements to most of array
   - More severe with increased constraints

---

5.3 PROPOSED SOLUTION 1: PARTIALLY CONTROLLED ELEMENT LOCATIONS

Core Principle:
Limit optimization to only outer (edge) elements while keeping inner (center)
elements fixed at uniform spacing positions. This reduces search space and
overlap probability.

Implementation Strategy:

Step 1: Identify Element Groups
   - Inner elements: Center portion of array (fixed at uniform positions)
   - Outer elements: Edge portions of array (allowed to optimize)
   - Number of controlled elements: Variable (full, half, quarter options)

Step 2: Optimization Constraints
   - Inner elements: xₙ = xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ (FIXED)
   - Outer elements: xₙ variable with bounds d̄/2 ≤ xₙ ≤ LUAA (WIDE bounds)
   - Bounds maintain overall array aperture

Step 3: Genetic Algorithm Execution
   - Only outer element locations included in optimization variables
   - Reduced search space (fewer degrees of freedom)
   - Cost function evaluated as before (Equation 3)

Performance Advantages:
   - Significantly reduced computational time
     * Full control: 7.875 seconds
     * Half control: 5.471 seconds (30% faster)
     * Quarter control: 2.27 seconds (71% faster)
   - Still achieves good sidelobe reduction
     * Full control: 18.6 dB
     * Half control: 15.5 dB
     * Quarter control: 15.2 dB (BEST SLL)
   - Directivity improvement possible
     * Quarter control achieves 28.0 dB (vs. 28.3 dB uniform reference)
   - Fewer optimization iterations needed

Performance Disadvantages:
   - Some residual element overlaps still possible with wide bounds
   - Reduced optimization freedom (fewer controlled elements)
   - Slightly different sidelobe behavior than full optimization
   - Half control: 15.5 dB vs. Full control: 18.6 dB (but full control has more error)

Design Variations Studied:
   1. Full element control (20 optimized):
      - D = 27.2 dB, SLL = 18.6 dB, T = 7.875 s
      - Overlaps present: YES (multiple)
   
   2. Half element control (10 optimized, 10 fixed):
      - D = 27.3 dB, SLL = 15.5 dB, T = 5.471 s
      - Overlaps present: YES (2 elements)
   
   3. Quarter element control (5 optimized, 15 fixed):
      - D = 28.0 dB, SLL = 15.2 dB, T = 2.27 s
      - Overlaps present: YES (residual, elements bunched)

Implementation Recommendation:
Quarter control offers best computational efficiency with acceptable performance,
though still requires modification for practical implementation due to residual
overlaps.

5.4 PROPOSED SOLUTION 2: BOUND CONSTRAINTS ON ELEMENT LOCATIONS

Core Principle:
Enforce individual minimum and maximum location bounds on every element location
to prevent overlaps while maintaining full optimization capability. This is the
primary contribution of the paper.

Implementation Strategy:

Step 1: Set Individual Bounds for Each Element
   Constraint equation:
   xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ - ε ≤ xₙ ≤ xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ + ε

   Where:
   - ε = User-specified margin (e.g., ±0.1λ)
   - xⁿᵤₙᵢfₒᵣₘ = Reference position from uniform array
   - Range allows element movement around original position

Step 2: Ensure Minimum Spacing
   Additional constraint:
   xₙ - xₙ₋₁ ≥ dₘᵢₙ for all n

   Implementation: ε chosen such that this automatically satisfied

Step 3: Genetic Algorithm with Constraints
   - All element locations included in optimization
   - Each location bounded by individual constraints
   - Cost function evaluated within feasible region
   - GA respects bounds during mutation/crossover operations

Step 4: Verification
   - Check final solution for overlaps (should be ZERO)
   - Verify all elements within their bounds
   - Compute performance metrics

Performance Advantages (PRIMARY SOLUTION):
   - ZERO element overlaps achieved in ALL cases
   - Complete elimination of overlap problem
   - Maintains full optimization degrees of freedom
   - Acceptable performance achieved
   - Guaranteed practical implementation feasibility
   - Directivity well-preserved
   - Sidelobe performance acceptable
   
   Performance Summary:
   - Full control + bounds: D = 27.74 dB, SLL = 17.0 dB, T = 9.2 s
   - Half control + bounds: D = 27.66 dB, SLL = 16.0 dB, T = 5.1 s

Performance Disadvantages:
   - Increased computational time vs. unconstrained optimization
   - Slightly higher sidelobe levels than full unconstrained optimization
     (17.0 dB vs. 18.6 dB) [Note: Lower is worse in dB magnitude]
   - Requires careful selection of ε parameter

Results with Bound Constraints:

   Full Control + Bounds:
   - Directivity: 27.74 dB

   - Computational Time: 5.1 seconds (45% faster)
   - Overlaps: ZERO ✓
   - Implementation: FEASIBLE ✓
   - Trade-off: Best practical balance

6.2 SIDELOBE LEVEL vs. NUMBER OF CONTROLLED ELEMENTS

Performance Trend Analysis (Figure 4a):

Data Summary:
   Number of Controlled Elements | SLL (dB) | Trend
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   5 (quarter)                   | 15.2     | Minimum SLL
   10 (half)                     | 15.5     | Slightly higher
   20 (full)                     | 18.6     | Highest SLL
   0 (uniform reference)         | ~20      | Baseline

Key Observations:
   1. Sharp SLL reduction with partial control
      - Uniform array: ~20 dB baseline
      - Quarter control: 15.2 dB (4.8 dB improvement)
      - Efficiency: 0.96 dB improvement per controlled element (5 elements)
   
   2. Counter-intuitive trend: More control → Worse SLL
      - Quarter control (5 elements): 15.2 dB (BEST)
      - Half control (10 elements): 15.5 dB
      - Full control (20 elements): 18.6 dB (WORST)
      - Reason: Optimization convergence to local minima with more freedom
   
   3. Design trade-off:
      - Fewer controlled elements: Better SLL but less optimization freedom
      - More controlled elements: Worse SLL but more degrees of freedom
      - Optimization constraints force realistic solutions

Physical Interpretation:
The quarter-controlled approach optimizes only outer elements (where they have
maximum effect on sidelobe pattern). Inner elements remain uniform, providing
stable pattern core. This balanced approach achieves best SLL performance.

   Half (10)            | 27.3 dB          | Very close
   Quarter (5)          | 28.0 dB          | Higher
   Uniform reference    | 28.3 dB          | Baseline

Key Observations:
   1. Directivity range: 22–29 dB across all configurations
      - Minimum: 22 dB (with maximum controlled elements)
      - Maximum: 29 dB (with minimal control)
      - Total range: 7 dB variation
   
   2. Counter-intuitive trend: FEWER controls → HIGHER directivity
      - Quarter (5): 28.0 dB (99% of reference)
      - Half (10): 27.3 dB (96% of reference)
      - Full (20): 27.2 dB (96% of reference)
      - Difference: 0.8 dB between quarter and full
   
   3. Interpretation:
      - More degrees of freedom allow pattern distortion
      - Constrained solutions maintain beam characteristics
      - Quarter control limits "optimization damage" to directivity

Performance vs. Reference:
   - All strategies achieve >95% of uniform array directivity
   - Excellent directivity preservation despite element location changes
   - Trade-off: Slightly lower D for significant SLL reduction

================================================================================

Problem Addressed:
Non-uniformly spaced antenna arrays offer superior pattern control compared
to uniformly spaced arrays. However, standard optimization produces element
location overlaps, making designs impractical.

Solutions Proposed:

Solution 1: Partially Controlled Element Locations
- Limits optimization to outer elements only
- Inner elements fixed at uniform positions
- Results: Reduced computation, but residual overlaps remain

Solution 2: Bound Constraints on Element Locations (PRIMARY)
- Individual bounds enforced on each element
- Prevents overlaps completely
- Results: ZERO overlaps, practical implementation guaranteed

Key Results:

Problem Elimination:
✓ Element overlap problem solved with bound constraints
✓ Zero overlaps achieved for both full and half control
✓ Guaranteed practical implementation feasibility

Performance Achievement:
✓ Sidelobe levels: 16-17 dB (4 dB improvement over uniform)
✓ Directivity: 27.66-27.74 dB (97-98% of reference)
✓ Beam steering: Maintained across ±0.5 radians

Computational Efficiency:
✓ Computational time: 2.27-9.2 seconds (acceptable range)
✓ Half control + bounds: 5.1 s (optimal balance)
✓ Up to 4× speedup with quarter control

Recommended Solution:
Half-controlled elements with bound constraints
- Directivity: 27.66 dB (excellent)
- SLL: 16.0 dB (good)
- Time: 5.1 seconds (practical)
- Overlaps: ZERO
- Status: Ready for implementation
