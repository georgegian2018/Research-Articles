## 4. EQUATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS

### Equation 1: Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) from Far-Field Radiation

**Equation:**
```
ρₑ = |∫∫₄π [F₁(θ, φ)* · F₂(θ, φ)] dΩ|² / {∫∫₄π |F₁(θ, φ)|² dΩ · ∫∫₄π |F₂(θ, φ)|² dΩ}
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- F₁(θ, φ) = three-dimensional far-field radiation pattern of antenna element 1
- F₂(θ, φ) = three-dimensional far-field radiation pattern of antenna element 2
- * = complex conjugate operator
- · = dot product
- Ω = solid angle
- dΩ = solid angle differential element

**Application:** [file:26]
- Used to evaluate MIMO performance and channel correlation
- ECC values of single-band system: < 0.007 (excellent diversity)
- ECC values of dual-band system: < 0.317 (lower band), < 0.009 (higher band)
- Criterion: ECC should be < 0.5 for acceptable MIMO performance

---

### Equation 2: Mean Effective Gain (MEG) - Taga's Formula

**Equation:**
```
MEG = ∫₀²π ∫₀π {[XPR/(1+XPR)] × Gθ(θ, φ) × Pθ(θ, φ) + [1/(1+XPR)] × Gφ(θ, φ) × Pφ(θ, φ)} sin θ dθ dφ
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- MEG = mean effective gain (ratio of mean received power to total mean incident power)
- XPR = cross-polarization power ratio (mean incident power ratio of vertically and horizontally polarized waves)
- Gθ(θ, φ) = antenna gain component in theta direction
- Gφ(θ, φ) = antenna gain component in phi direction
- Pθ(θ, φ) = theta component of normalized angular power density function of incoming plane waves
- Pφ(θ, φ) = phi component of normalized angular power density function of incoming plane waves
- θ = elevation angle (0 to π)
- φ = azimuth angle (0 to 2π)
- sin θ dθ dφ = solid angle weighting element

**Application:** [file:26]
- MEGs of all proposed antenna elements remain stable within operational bands
- MEGs approximately satisfy equality criteria for good MIMO diversity and system power balancing
- Single-band MEG: approximately –3.5 to –4.5 dB
- Dual-band MEG: approximately –2.5 to –4.5 dB

---

### Equation 3: Diversity Gain (DG)

**Equation:**
```
G_DG = 10 × √(1 - |ρ|²)
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- G_DG = diversity gain (in dB)
- ρ = correlation coefficient (from ECC)
- |ρ|² = magnitude squared of correlation coefficient
- √(1 - |ρ|²) = diversity factor

**Application:** [file:26]
- Single-band diversity gain: > 9.96 dB
- Dual-band diversity gain: > 9.82 dB
- Higher values indicate better MIMO performance and lower antenna correlation

Fig. 3. The process of generating a modified Peano pre-fractal curve.
based on the second iteration of a modified Peano-type fractal
geometry [12]. The process of generating a modified Peano
pre-fractal curve is shown in Fig. 3.
The proposed fractal geometry is combined with a 50Ωtrans-
mission line. RF signal is fed from a coax connector to the
hole in the ground layer.
3. Performance Analysis
Figure 4 presents the results of S-parameter simulations for
the proposed single-band, four-element MIMO antenna. One
may notice that the desired single operating band of 3.445–
3.885 GHz for 5G n77 and n78 bands applications is achieved
with an acceptable impedance matching of less than –6 dB,
meaning that a 3:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) has
been achieved, as shown in Fig. 4a. As illustrated in Fig. 4b,
decent isolation better than 23 dB is achieved by applying the
self-isolated and spatial diversity methodologies, where the
four MIMO antennas are placed at the corners of the PCB.
The transmission coefficients are better than: S12 –23 dB, S13
–30 dB, S14 –37 dB (diagonal distance), S15 –26 dB, and S16
–35 dB.
Figure 5 shows the S-parameters of the dual band MIMO
antenna design proposed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the operat-
ing range of 1.684–2.300 GHz for n2, n3, n39, n65, and n66

bands, and 4.432–5.638 GHz for n79 and 5.15–5.63 GHz for
WLAN bands, works with an impedance matching score of
less than –6 dB (3:1 VSWR). From Fig. 5b, suitable isolation
of better than 16 dB in the higher band and acceptable iso-
lation better than 10 dB in the lower band is attained using
the self-isolated method, i.e., without inserting any decou-
pling parameters or/and deploying any isolation techniques,
where the four MIMO antennas are located closely to each
other, in the middle of the mobile phone’s PCB. Only the
essential transmission coefficients of the lower band are intro-
duced, which are all better than the accepted level of –10 dB.
These are as follows: the S51 ≈–14 dB, S53 ≈–19 dB, S56
≈–10 dB, S57 ≈–10 dB, and S58 ≈–13 dB. In contrast, the
transmission coefficients of the higher band are as follows:
S51 ≈–20 dB, S53 ≈–29 dB, S56 ≈–26 dB, S57 ≈–16 dB,
and S58 ≈–28 dB.
Figure 6 illustrates the efficiencies of the single-band four
MIMO antennas setup. As illustrated, radiation antenna effi-
ciency and total antenna efficiency levels that are acceptable
for mobile phone applications are obtained. The radiation and
total antenna efficiencies are between 67–82% and 50–76%,
respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, good antenna gains are
obtained, where the maximum gain in the working band is
almost 2.6 dB. The efficiencies of the four antennas of the
dual-band MIMO antenna system are shown in Fig. 8. Decent
radiation and total antenna efficiencies are attained, remain-
ing between 81–90% and 47–60%, for the lower band. For
the higher band, the scores of between 79–87% and 56–84%
are obtained. High antenna gains

fficiencies of the single-band four
MIMO antennas setup. As illustrated, radiation antenna effi-
ciency and total antenna efficiency levels that are acceptable
for mobile phone applications are obtained. The radiation and
total antenna efficiencies are between 67–82% and 50–76%,
respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, good antenna gains are

ing between 81–90% and 47–60%, for the lower band. For
the higher band, the scores of between 79–87% and 56–84%
are obtained. High antenna gains can be also observed in Fig.
9, with the maximum gain that can be reached in the lower
operating band equaling approximately 3.5 dB, and approxi-
mately 4.3 dB in the higher operating band.
For clarity and due to the similarity of results, one-sided anten-
nas (ant. 1, 3, 5, and ant. 6) are considered. Figure 10 presents
two-dimensional radiation patterns at the working bands,
while Fig. 11 depicts, for comparison, three-dimensional
radiation patterns. As shown in the pictures, each antenna el-
ement has a maximum gain direction that differs from the
maximum gain orientations of the other antennas, suggesting
decent pattern diversity characteristics. Furthermore, each
antenna’s radiation pattern covers both sides of the mobile
device PCB board. As a result, the proposed MIMO antenna
systems achieve the expected level of radiation coverage.

based on the second iteration of a modified Peano-type fractal

pre-fractal curve is shown in Fig. 3.
The proposed fractal geometry is combined with a 50Ωtrans-
mission line. RF signal is fed from a coax connector to the
hole in the ground layer.
3. Performance Analysis
Figure 4 presents the results of S-parameter simulations for
the proposed single-band, four-element MIMO antenna. One
may notice that the desired single operating band of 3.445–
3.885 GHz for 5G n77 and n78 bands applications is achieved
with an acceptable impedance matching of less than –6 dB,
meaning that a 3:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) has
been achieved, as shown in Fig. 4a. As illustrated in Fig. 4b,
decent isolation better than 23 dB is achieved by applying the
self-isolated and spatial diversity methodologies, where the
four MIMO antennas are placed at the corners of the PCB.
The transmission coefficients are better than: S12 –23 dB, S13
–30 dB, S14 –37 dB (diagonal distance), S15 –26 dB, and S16
–35 dB.
Figure 5 shows the S-parameters of the dual band MIMO
antenna design proposed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the operat-

four antennas are positioned in the middle of the terminal board,
supports two wide bands of 1.684–2.300 GHz and 4.432–5.638

1. Introduction
The constantly increasing data transmission rates and the
advent of smart services motivate researchers to develop
wireless communication techniques. This leads to the need
of an antenna system that can simultaneously operate with
different frequencies, providing high data rates, good quality
of service, and very low latency [1], [2]. The 5G technolo-
gy and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recognized as the key
trends capable of transforming education, industry, health-
care, and other public areas in the future [3].
The MIMO antenna technology is utilized for 5G mobile
terminals to enhance spectrum efficiency and channel capaci-
ty [4], [5]. However, an increase in the number of antennas
creates integration issues due to the constrained space avail-
able in mobile devices [6], [7]. Many techniques have been
used to deal with this problem, including the multimode
decoupling method [8] and the hybrid decoupling method
(neutralization line and ground slot) [9]. Nevertheless, anten-
na efficiency was significantly reduced because of additional
isolation-related components.
The self-isolated approach has been revealed to provide high
isolation and antenna efficiency [10], [11]. However, such
antenna systems operate in a single band only. As a result,

bands, and 4.432–5.638 GHz for n79 and 5.15–5.63 GHz for
WLAN bands, works with an impedance matching score of
less than –6 dB (3:1 VSWR). From Fig. 5b, suitable isolation
of better than 16 dB in the higher band and acceptable iso-
lation better than 10 dB in the lower band is attained using
the self-isolated method, i.e., without inserting any decou-
pling parameters or/and deploying any isolation techniques,
where the four MIMO antennas are located closely to each
other, in the middle of the mobile phone’s PCB. Only the
essential transmission coefficients of the lower band are intro-
duced, which are all better than the accepted level of –10 dB.
These are as follows: the S51 ≈–14 dB, S53 ≈–19 dB, S56
≈–10 dB, S57 ≈–10 dB, and S58 ≈–13 dB. In contrast, the
transmission coefficients of the higher band are as follows:
S51 ≈–20 dB, S53 ≈–29 dB, S56 ≈–26 dB, S57 ≈–16 dB,
and S58 ≈–28 dB.
Figure 6 illustrates the efficiencies of the single-band four
MIMO antennas setup. As illustrated, radiation antenna effi-
ciency and total antenna efficiency levels that are acceptable
for mobile phone applications are obtained. The radiation and
total antenna efficiencies are between 67–82% and 50–76%,
respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, good antenna gains are
obtained, where the maximum gain in the working band is
almost 2.6 dB. The efficiencies of the four antennas of the
dual-band MIMO antenna system are shown in Fig. 8. Decent
radiation and total antenna efficiencies are attained, remain-
ing between 81–90% and 47–60%, for the lower band. For
the higher band, the scores of between 79–87% and 56–84%
are obtained. High antenna gains can be also observed in Fig.
9, with the maximum gain that can be reached in the lower
operating band equaling approximately 3.5 dB, and approxi-

For clarity and due to the similarity of results, one-sided anten-
nas (ant. 1, 3, 5, and ant. 6) are considered. Figure 10 presents
two-dimensional radiation patterns at the working bands,
while Fig. 11 depicts, for comparison, three-dimensional
radiation patterns. As shown in the pictures, each antenna el-
ement has a maximum gain direction that differs from the
maximum gain orientations of the other antennas, suggesting
decent pattern diversity characteristics. Furthermore, each
antenna’s radiation pattern covers both sides of the mobile
device PCB board. As a result, the proposed MIMO antenna
systems achieve the expected level of radiation coverage.

different frequencies, providing high data rates, good quality
of service, and very low latency [1], [2]. The 5G technolo-
gy and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recognized as the key
trends capable of transforming education, industry, health-
care, and other public areas in the future [3].
The MIMO antenna technology is utilized for 5G mobile
terminals to enhance spectrum efficiency and channel capaci-
ty [4], [5]. However, an increase in the number of antennas
creates integration issues due to the constrained space avail-
able in mobile devices [6], [7]. Many techniques have been
used to deal with this problem, including the multimode
decoupling method [8] and the hybrid decoupling method
(neutralization line and ground slot) [9]. Nevertheless, anten-
na efficiency was significantly reduced because of additional
isolation-related components.
The self-isolated approach has been revealed to provide high
isolation and antenna efficiency [10], [11]. However, such
antenna systems operate in a single band only. As a result,
developing a small, multi-band MIMO antenna with good
performance and a high isolation rate has become a signifi-
cant challenge.
A compact dual-functional antenna array is presented in this
study for use in multi-band MIMO applications in mobile
devices supporting 5G. Adequate isolation is accomplished
without inserting any decoupling

The proposed fractal geometry is combined with a 50Ωtrans-
mission line. RF signal is fed from a coax connector to the
hole in the ground layer.
3. Performance Analysis
Figure 4 presents the results of S-parameter simulations for
the proposed single-band, four-element MIMO antenna. One
may notice that the desired single operating band of 3.445–
3.885 GHz for 5G n77 and n78 bands applications is achieved
with an acceptable impedance matching of less than –6 dB,
meaning that a 3:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) has
been achieved, as shown in Fig. 4a. As illustrated in Fig. 4b,
decent isolation better than 23 dB is achieved by applying the
self-isolated and spatial diversity methodologies, where the
four MIMO antennas are placed at the corners of the PCB.
The transmission coefficients are better than: S12 –23 dB, S13
–30 dB, S14 –37 dB (diagonal distance), S15 –26 dB, and S16
–35 dB.
Figure 5 shows the S-parameters of the dual band MIMO
antenna design proposed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the operat-

Abstract This article introduces a dual-functional low-profile
compact multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna array
for multi-band communication in 5G smartphones. The pro-
posed eight elements of the antenna array form two different 4×4
MIMO systems. The first four elements are placed at the four
mobile corners and operate in a single band of 3.445–3.885 GHz
for 5G n77 and n78 applications. The other system, in which
four antennas are positioned in the middle of the terminal board,
supports two wide bands of 1.684–2.300 GHz and 4.432–5.638
for n2, n3, n39, n65, n66, n79, and WLAN applications. The sec-
ond iteration of a modified Peano-type fractal geometry served
as the design foundation for the proposed antenna element. The
system’s ground plane design is based on self-isolated and spa-
tial diversity methods. The single-band MIMO system’s isolation
is better than 23 dB. In the dual-band MIMO system that is
based on self-isolation, isolation equals approximately 16 dB
in the higher band and 10 dB in the lower band. To evaluate
performance, radiation-related and total antenna efficiencies,
scattering parameters and gains were investigated. Additionally,
ECCs have been considered to evaluate MIMO performance. Ac-
cording to the results, such design constitutes a valuable option
for MIMO applications in 5G smartphones.

the proposed single-band, four-element MIMO antenna. One
may notice that the desired single operating band of 3.445–
3.885 GHz for 5G n77 and n78 bands applications is achieved
with an acceptable impedance matching of less than –6 dB,
meaning that a 3:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) has
been achieved, as shown in Fig. 4a. As illustrated in Fig. 4b,
decent isolation better than 23 dB is achieved by applying the
self-isolated and spatial diversity methodologies, where the
four MIMO antennas are placed at the corners of the PCB.
The transmission coefficients are better than: S12 –23 dB, S13
–30 dB, S14 –37 dB (diagonal distance), S15 –26 dB, and S16
–35 dB.

ultiple output (MIMO) antenna array
for multi-band communication in 5G smartphones. The pro-
posed eight elements of the antenna array form two different 4×4
MIMO systems. The first four elements are placed at the four
mobile corners and operate in a single band of 3.445–3.885 GHz
for 5G n77 and n78 applications. The other system, in which
four antennas are positioned in the middle of the terminal board,
supports two wide bands of 1.684–2.300 GHz and 4.432–5.638
for n2, n3, n39, n65, n66, n79, and WLAN applications. The sec-
ond iteration of a modified Peano-type fractal geometry served
as the design foundation for the proposed antenna element. The
system’s ground plane design is based on self-isolated and spa-
tial diversity methods. The single-band MIMO system’s isolation
is better than 23 dB. In the dual-band MIMO system that is
based on self-isolation, isolation equals approximately 16 dB
in the higher band and 10 dB in the lower band. To evaluate
performance, radiation-related and total antenna efficiencies,
scattering parameters and gains were investigated. Additionally,
ECCs have been considered to evaluate MIMO performance. Ac-
cording to the results, such design constitutes a valuable option
for MIMO applications in 5G smartphones.

1. Introduction
The constantly increasing data transmission rates and the
advent of smart services motivate researchers to develop
wireless communication techniques. This leads to the need
of an antenna system that can simultaneously operate with
different frequencies, providing high data rates, good quality
of service, and very low latency [1], [2]. The 5G technolo-
gy and the Internet of Things (IoT) are recognized as the key
trends capable of transforming education, industry, health-
care, and other public areas in the future [3].
The MIMO antenna technology is utilized for 5G mobile
terminals to enhance spectrum efficiency and channel capaci-
ty [4], [5]. However, an increase in the number of antennas
creates integration issues due to the constrained space avail-
able in mobile devices [6], [7]. Many techniques have been
used to deal with this problem, including the multimode
decoupling method [8] and the hybrid decoupling method
(neutralization line and ground slot) [9]. Nevertheless, anten-
na efficiency was significantly reduced because of additional
iso

2. Proposed Antenna Array
The design of an eight-element dual MIMO antenna array
for 5G handset applications is shown in Fig. 1. The antenna
array comprises two different 4×4 MIMO systems. The four
antennas (ant. 1–4) in the corners of the main PCB are relied
upon to build a MIMO system which can operate in a single
3.445–3.885 GHz band, as part of the 5G n77 and n78 NR
(new radio) bands. The other four MIMO elements (ant. 5–8)
are placed in the middle of the PCB and support wide bands
of 1.684–2.300 GHz for n2, n3, n39, n65, n66 4.432–5.638
GHz for n79, and 5.15-5.63 GHz WLAN.
All eight antenna elements are located on the top layer made
of a 0.8 mm thick double-sided FR4 substrate with a relative
permittivity of 4.3 and a loss tangent of 0.02, as shown in
Fig. 1a. The thickness of the conductive layer is 35 µm. The
system’s circuit board has the size of 150×75 mm – a stan-
dard dimension for mobile phones. The ground bottom layer
enhances the antenna’s impedance matching and bandwidth,
as shown in Fig. 1b. However, in the proposed design, the
ground layer is slightly modified to achieve two different 4×4
MIMO systems. Figure 2 presents the design of a single com-
pact monopole antenna element with its dimensions being

bands, and 4.432–5.638 GHz for n79 and 5.15–5.63 GHz for
WLAN bands, works with an impedance matching score of
less than –6 dB (3:1 VSWR). From Fig. 5b, suitable isolation
of better than 16 dB in the higher band and acceptable iso-
lation better than 10 dB in the lower band is attained using
the self-isolated method, i.e., without inserting any decou-
pling parameters or/and deploying any isolation techniques,
where the four MIMO antennas are located closely to each
other, in the middle of the mobile phone’s PCB. Only the
essential transmission coefficients of the lower band are intro-
duced, which are all better than the accepted level of –10 dB.
These are as follows: the S51 ≈–14 dB, S53 ≈–19 dB, S56
≈–10 dB, S57 ≈–10 dB, and S58 ≈–13 dB. In contrast, the
transmission coefficients of the higher band are as follows:
S51 ≈–20 dB, S53 ≈–29 dB, S56 ≈–26 dB, S57 ≈–16 dB,
and S58 ≈–28 dB.
Figure 6 illustrates the efficiencies of the single-band four
MIMO antennas setup. As illustrated, radiation antenna effi-
ciency and total antenna efficiency levels that are acceptable
for mobile phone applications are obtained. The radiation and
total antenna efficiencies are between 67–82% and 50–76%,
respectively. As presented in Fig. 7, good antenna gains are
obtained, where the maximum gain in the working band is
almost 2.6 dB. The efficiencies of the four antennas of the
dual-band MIMO antenna system are shown in Fig. 8. Decent
radiation and total antenna efficiencies are attained, remain-
ing between 81–90% and 47–60%, for the lower band. For
the higher band, the scores of between 79–87% and 56–84%
are obtained. High antenna gains can be also observed in Fig.
9, with the maximum gain that can be reached in the lower
operating band equaling approximately 3.5 dB, and approxi-
mately 4.3 dB in the higher operating band.
For clarity and due to the similarity of results, one-sided anten-
nas (ant. 1, 3, 5, and ant. 6) are considered. Figure 10 presents
two-dimensional radiation patterns at the working bands,
while Fig. 11 depicts, for comparison, three-dimensional
radiation patterns. As shown in the pictures, each antenna el-
ement has a maximum gain direction that differs from the
maximum gain orientations of the other antennas, suggesting
decent pattern diversity characteristics. Furthermore, each
antenna’s radiation pattern covers both sides of the mobile
device PCB board. As a result, the proposed MIMO antenna
systems achieve the expected level of radiation coverage.

is considerably below the accepted criterion according to
which ECCs should be less than 0.5 in the MIMO systems.

shown in Fig. 13, all the ECCs are lower than 0.317 within
the lower working band, while the ECCs of the higher band
are below 0.009. Thus, the proposed four-element MIMO an-
tenna offers outstanding diversity performance due to its low
ECC values.
One of the effective performance criteria for MIMO systems
is the mean effective gain (MEG), defined as the ratio between
the mean received power of the antenna and the total mean in-
cident power [17]. MEG can be calculated using Taga’s [18]
formula:
MEG =

sin θ dθ dϕ .

The cross-polarization power ratio (XPR) is the mean incident
power ratio of vertically and horizontally polarized waves.
Pθ and Pϕ represent the theta and phi components of the
normalized angular power density functions of the incoming
plane waves, respectively. In contrast, Gθ and Gϕ represent
the antenna gain components. It is worth noting that the MEGs
of the MIMO antennas should be close to equal to ensure
good MIMO system diversity performance and system power
balancing [19].
Figure 14 illustrates the MEG of the proposed single-band
and dual-band MIMO antenna systems. The MEGs for all
antennas of the proposed single-band and dual-band antenna
systems are stable within the operational bands. Furthermore,
in the MIMO system, the MEGs approximately satisfy the
equality criteria applicable to antenna elements.
The diversity gain of the proposed single-band and dual-band
MIMO antenna systems can be estimated with the use of
a formula relative to the correlation coefficient GDG [20],
[21], such as:
GDG = 10 ×
p
1 −|ρ|2 ,

High-diversity gain performance of the single-band and dual-
band MIMO antenna system is shown in Fig. 15. It is better
than 9.96 dB in the single-band antenna system and better
than 9.82 dB in the dual-band antenna system.

### Section 4: Comparison with Other Works (extracted)


4. Comparison with Other Works
Table 1 compares the performance of the proposed single-band and dual-band MIMO antenna systems with that of other recent MIMO antenna systems developed for 5G mobile terminals. As shown, the proposed solution offers a compact size antenna element, expected isolation, and adequate total antenna efficiencies thanks to employing spatial diversity and self-isolated methodology for the single-band antenna system and self-isolated technique for the dual-band antenna system.
Therefore, no antenna efficiency losses are caused by other isolation elements and/or decoupling techniques.
