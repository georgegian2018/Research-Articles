## SECTION 4: EQUATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS

### 4.1 Friis Transmission Equation (Free-Space Path Loss)

**Standard Friis Formula:**
$$P_r = P_t G_t G_r \left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}\right)^2$$

Where:
- $P_r$ = Received power (watts)
- $P_t$ = Transmitted power (watts)
- $G_t$ = Transmit antenna gain (linear)
- $G_r$ = Receive antenna gain (linear)
- $\lambda$ = Wavelength of transmitted signal (meters)
- $d$ = Distance between transmitter and receiver (meters)

**Application:** Fundamental equation for calculating THz propagation path loss

### 4.2 Free-Space Path Loss in Decibels

**Logarithmic Form:**
$$PL = 10 \lg \frac{P_t}{P_r} = 20 \lg \left(\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}\right) - 10 \lg(G_t G_r)$$

**Frequency-Dependent Form:**
$$PL(f) = 20 \lg f + 20 \lg d + 20 \lg \left(\frac{4\pi}{c}\right) - 10 \lg(G_t G_r)$$

**Key Characteristic:** Path loss increases 20 dB per decade of frequency increase
- Example: Loss increases by 20 dB from 30 GHz to 300 GHz (when distance and gains are constant)

### 4.3 Receive Antenna Effective Aperture

**Relationship Between Gain and Aperture:**
$$A_r = G_r \left(\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi}\right)$$

Where:
- $A_r$ = Effective aperture area (square meters)
- $G_r$ = Receive antenna gain (linear)
- $\lambda$ = Wavelength (meters)

**Key Insight:** For fixed antenna gain, effective aperture decreases with frequency squared, contributing to high THz path loss

### 4.4 Atmospheric Absorption Loss

**General Expression:**
$$\alpha(f,h) = \int_0^h \alpha_0(f, \text{altitude}) \, dz$$

Where:
- $\alpha(f,h)$ = Absorption coefficient at frequency $f$ over height $h$
- $\alpha_0(f, \text{altitude})$ = Specific absorption coefficient as function of frequency and altitude
- $h$ = Propagation distance through atmosphere

**Notable Characteristics:**
- Strong absorption peaks at specific molecular resonances (water vapor, oxygen)
- Absorption can exceed 1000 dB/km in worst-case scenarios
- Highly frequency-dependent with major peaks at 60 GHz, 118 GHz, 183 GHz, etc.

### 4.5 Molecular Absorption Lines (Key Frequencies)

**Water Vapor Absorption Line:**
$$f_{H_2O} \approx 183.31 \text{ GHz}$$

**Oxygen Absorption Line:**
$$f_{O_2} \approx 118.75 \text{ GHz}$$

**Secondary Oxygen Line:**
$$f_{O_2, 2nd} \approx 60 \text{ GHz}$$

**Significance:** These frequencies experience extreme atmospheric absorption, creating "opaque windows" for THz communications

- Small aperture area of THz antennas (due to short wavelength) contributes to high loss
- Even with optimum antenna gains, THz signals require high transmit power or short distances

### 7.2 Atmospheric Absorption

**Frequency-Dependent Absorption (Sea Level):**

| Frequency Range | Attenuation | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| 100–118 GHz | Moderate (~5–20 dB/km) | Below O₂ main line |

| 183 GHz | Very high (>100 dB/km) | Water vapor resonance |
| 183–275 GHz | Extremely high (>200 dB/km) | Peak absorption region |
| 275–325 GHz | Reduced (20–50 dB/km) | Atmospheric window |
| >325 GHz | Rapidly increasing | Approaching infrared |

**Physical Mechanism:**

### 7.4 Blockage Effects

**Blockage Mechanisms:**

|---|---|---|---|
| **Path Loss** | ~70–90 dB/km | ~90–130 dB/km | >130 dB/km |
| **Atmospheric Absorption** | Negligible | Low (~5 dB/km typical) | Very high (>100 dB/km peak) |
| **Scattering** | Significant | Moderate | Low (geometrical optics) |
| **Diffraction** | Significant | Moderate | Negligible |
| **Beam Width** | Wide (10–30°) | Narrow (1–5°) | Very narrow (<1°) |
| **Array Size** | Large (1–100 m²) | Medium (0.01–0.1 m²) | Small (<0.01 m²) |

### SECTION 3: EQUATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS

#### 3.1 Friis Transmission Equation (Fundamental Path Loss Formula)

**Standard Form:**
Pr = Pt × Gt × Gr × (λ / 4πd)²

Where:
- Pr = Received power (watts)
- Pt = Transmitted power (watts)
- Gt = Transmit antenna gain (linear scale)
- Gr = Receive antenna gain (linear scale)
- λ = Wavelength (meters)
- d = Distance (meters)

**Logarithmic Form (dB):**
PL = 20 log(4πd/λ) – 10 log(Gt·Gr)

**Key Property:** Path loss increases 20 dB per frequency decade
- Example: 100× frequency increase = 20 dB loss increase (if all else constant)
- From 30 GHz to 300 GHz = 20 dB additional loss
- From 30 GHz to 3 THz = 40 dB additional loss

#### 3.2 Frequency-Domain Path Loss Expression

PL(f) = 20 log(f) + 20 log(d) + 20 log(4π/c) – 10 log(Gt·Gr)

Where:
- f = Frequency (Hz)
- c = Speed of light (3×10⁸ m/s)
- Other terms as above

#### 3.3 Antenna Aperture and Gain Relationship

Ar = Gr × (λ² / 4π)

Where:

- α₀(f, altitude) = Specific absorption at given altitude and frequency
- h = Propagation distance through atmosphere

**Characteristics:**
- Highly frequency-dependent
- Strong peaks at molecular resonances (60 GHz, 118 GHz, 183 GHz, etc.)
