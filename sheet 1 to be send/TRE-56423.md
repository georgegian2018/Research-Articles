## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This paper presents the design, simulation, and parametric optimization of microstrip patch antennas (MPAs) for the 5G n77 frequency band (3.3-4.2 GHz). Four distinct antennas resonating at 3.5 GHz were analyzed using HFSS simulation software. The designs employed coaxial and inset feeding techniques with FR-4 and Rogers RT/duroid 5880 substrates. Antenna 4, utilizing inset feed with RT/duroid 5880 substrate, demonstrated superior performance with a return loss of –36.08 dB, VSWR of 1.0319, peak gain of 7.56 dB, and radiation efficiency of 99.70%.

## Abstract (as in paper)

```text
This paper presents the design, simulation, and parametric optimization of the microstrip patch anten¬ na for the 5G n77 frequency band. Four distinct antennas, each resonating at 3.5 GHz, were analyzed using the high-frequency structure simulator. The designs utilize coaxial and inset feeding techniques and incorporate FR-4 and Rogers RT/duroid 5880 substrates. The geometric parameters were system¬ atically optimized to enhance antenna performance. Among the designs, antenna 4, with a patch size of 27.8 × 32.85 mm², demonstrated superior performance, achieving a return loss of –36.08 dB, a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of 1.0319, a peak gain of 7.56 dB, and a radiation efficiency of 99.70%. Comparative analysis revealed that RT/duroid 5880 substrates outperformed FR-4 in terms of return loss, gain, and directivity. Additionally, the coaxial feed provided better bandwidth and impedance matching, while the inset feed excelled in gain, directivity, and radiation efficiency. These findings are crucial for developing efficient and reliable antennas for next-generation 5G applications.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section evaluates the performance of the four designed antennas, emphasizing key 
parameters, such as patch size, center frequency, bandwidth, return loss, VSWR, gain, 
directivity, and radiation efficiency. The optimized antennas demonstrated significant 
performance enhancements. Figures 6 to 9 present simulated plots of return loss (S11),

VSWR, 3D polar gain, and 2D radiation patterns for all antennas. Table 3 summarizes 
the simulation findings for both the initial and optimized design configurations.
3.1 Patch Size
The optimized patch sizes of the antennas vary significantly, as depicted in Table 2. An¬
tenna 1 has a patch size of 504.96 mm², making it the smallest, which may limit its gain,

bandwidth, directivity, and radiation efficiency. Antenna 2 has a slightly larger patch size 
of 509.55 mm², providing a minor increase in performance. Antenna 3 and Antenna 4 
have larger patch sizes, 916.65 mm² and 913.23 mm², respectively, which are likely to 
offer better gain, directivity, and radiation efficiency due to their larger areas. The larger 
patch sizes of Antennas 3 and 4 indicate a trade-off with increased size for improved 
performance. Smaller patch sizes in Antennas 1 and 2 are suitable for small designs but 
may compromise performance.
3.2 Frequency Response and Bandwidth
After optimization, all antennas were fine-tuned to a center frequency of 3.5 GHz. An¬
tenna 1’s frequency was adjusted from 3.37 GHz to 3.50 GHz, with its bandwidth in¬
creasing from 123 MHz to 137 MHz. Antenna 2’s frequency improved from 3.44 GHz 
to 3.50 GHz, and its bandwidth expanded from 102 MHz to 110 MHz. Antenna 3’s 
frequency shifted from 3.38 GHz to the desired 3.50 GHz, and its bandwidth increased 
from 99 MHz to 104 MHz. Antenna 4’s frequency was refined from 3.46 GHz to 3.50 
GHz, with bandwidth growing from 70 MHz to 72 MHz.
3.3 Return Loss and VSWR
Minimizing signal reflection and maximizing power transfer, particularly for high-
frequency 5G signals, requires a return loss of < –20 dB and VSWR near one. The

graphs in Fig. 6(a)–6(d) show the return loss (S11) vs. frequency plots for all antennas, 
while the simulated VSWR vs. frequency is displayed in Fig. 7(a)–7(d). The simula¬
tion results show significant improvements in both metrics after optimization. Antenna 
1’s return loss improved from –29.18 dB to –37.66 dB, with a VSWR reduction from 
1.0720 to 1.0265. Antenna 2’s return loss was enhanced from –23.19 dB to –34.00 dB, 
and the VSWR improved from 1.1488 to 1.0407. Antenna 3 saw its return loss improve 
from –16.43 dB to –22.02 dB, decreasing the VSWR from 1.3552 to 1.1720. Finally, 
Antenna 4’s return loss increased from –29.00 dB to –36.08 dB, with a VSWR reduc¬
tion from 1.0736 to 1.0319, indicating nearly perfect impedance matching across all 
antennas.
3.4 Gain, Directivity, and Radiation Efficiency
Figure 8(a)–8(d) displays the 3D polar gain patterns for all the antennas. The optimi¬
zation of the antennas led to modest improvements in these metrics. Antenna 1’s gain 
increased from 1.69 dB to 1.89 dB, with directivity improving from 3.19 dB to 3.61 
dB. Antenna 2 demonstrated a slight gain increase from 3.91 dB to 3.93 dB, while its 
directivity improved from 6.18 dB to 6.22 dB. For antenna 3, the gain improved from 
5.16 dB to 5.26 dB, and the directivity from 4.91 dB to 5.34 dB. Antenna 4’s gain 
increased from 7.50 dB to 7.56 dB, with directivity adjusted from 7.59 dB to 7.56 
dB, as depicted in Fig. 9. The radiation efficiency remained relatively stable for all 
antennas, with slight improvements. Antenna 1’s efficiency increased marginally from 
67.11% to 67.15%. Antenna 2’s efficiency improved from 58.73% to 58.82%. The ef¬
ficiency for Antenna 3 rose from 98.02% to 98.28%. Antenna 4’s efficiency increased 
from 99.64% to 99.70%, as shown in Fig. 10, indicating minimum losses and effective 
power conversion.

3.5 Radiation Pattern
Figure 11(a)–11(d) depicts radiation patterns for antennas, showing the distribution of 
radiated power in the E-plane (red curve) and the H-plane (green curve). Antenna 1 (Fig. 
11a) and Antenna 3 (Fig. 11c) exhibit similar patterns. In the E-plane, both show a main 
lobe directed perpendicular to the antenna surface with a significant notch behind the 
antenna, demonstrating high directivity. The H-plane pattern is symmetrical, indicating 
consistent horizontal radiation. Antenna 3 has a maximum radiation field of 18 dB. Both 
antennas show strong main lobes with reduced side lobes, suggesting effective radiation 
with minimal interference. Antenna 2 (Fig. 11b) and Antenna 4 (Fig. 11d) also exhibit

similar patterns. The E-plane shows a prominent main lobe with minimal side lobes, 
signifying robust and focused radiation. The H-plane displays a symmetrical pattern, 
ensuring consistent radiation across a wide angle. Antenna 4 has a maximum radiation 
field of 24 dB. The analysis highlights the effectiveness of these optimized antennas in 
providing focused, consistent radiation with minimal interference, suitable for 5G wire¬
less communication applications.

2. ANTENNA DESIGN AND PARAMETRIC OPTIMIZATION
This section presents the design and parametric optimization process of antennas resonat¬
ing at 3.5 GHz, highlighting the use of different feeding techniques and substrate materi¬
als to achieve optimal performance. Four different antennas were designed using coaxial

and inset feeding techniques. These antennas were built with FR-4 and Rogers RT/duroid 
5880 substrates, which are known for their excellent electrical properties. Table 1 shows the 
substrate properties used for the four antennas. The geometric parameters of these antennas 
were precisely calculated using the design in Eqs. (1)–(9) (Rahman et al., 2020). The patch, 
ground plane, and feed length dimensions were determined to achieve low return loss, high 
bandwidth, and efficient radiation characteristics. These initial designs were then imported 
into the Ansys high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS), version 2024R2, for simulation. 
Key performance metrics were evaluated, and parametric optimization techniques were ap¬
plied to refine the design. Table 2 lists the computed and optimized geometric dimensions of 
the four antennas. The parametric optimization process effectively reduced the patch sizes 
of all four antennas through dimension adjustments. Specifically, Antenna 1’s patch size de¬
creased by 3.09%, Antenna 2’s by 2.19%, Antenna 3’s by 3.57%, and Antenna 4’s by 3.93%.
