## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This paper presents the design, simulation, and parametric optimization of microstrip patch antennas (MPAs) for the 5G n77 frequency band (3.3-4.2 GHz). Four distinct antennas resonating at 3.5 GHz were analyzed using HFSS simulation software. The designs employed coaxial and inset feeding techniques with FR-4 and Rogers RT/duroid 5880 substrates. Antenna 4, utilizing inset feed with RT/duroid 5880 substrate, demonstrated superior performance with a return loss of –36.08 dB, VSWR of 1.0319, peak gain of 7.56 dB, and radiation efficiency of 99.70%.
