## III. ANTENNA ARRAY ENABLED EMERGING COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES

### A. New Beamforming Technologies

**Motivation:**
Conventional single-beam steering inadequate for future space/air/ground networks requiring:
- Massive user access
- High dynamics
- Limited RF chains
- On-demand coverage

#### 1) Single-RF-Chain Multiple Beams

**Problem Statement:**
- One RF chain typically generates one data stream
- Cannot serve all users as user count increases
- Limited RF chains in hybrid beamforming systems

**Solution Approaches:**

**Sub-Array Technique:**
- Divide antenna array into multiple sub-arrays
- Each sub-array generates beam in specific direction
- Adjacent antennas separated into groups
- Multiple sub-arrays generate analog beams to desired users

**Performance Analysis (64-Element Phased Array):**
- Two sub-arrays:
  - Generate 2 beams in different directions
  - Higher beam gain per beam
- Four sub-arrays:
  - Generate 4 beams
  - Lower beam gain per beam due to smaller sub-array size

**Trade-off:**
- Increasing sub-arrays = More beams but lower individual gains
- Must balance beam count and beam gain carefully

**Optimization Approach:**
For Nt-element array with I desired beams:

**Optimization Problem:**
$$\max_{f,\alpha} \alpha$$

**Subject to Constraints:**
$$|a^H_i f|^2 \geq \alpha, \quad i = 1, 2, ..., I$$
$$|[f]_n| = 1/\sqrt{N_t}, \quad n = 1, 2, ..., N_t$$

where:
- ai: steering vector of i-th desired beam
- f: analog beamforming vector
- α: slack variable for beam gain improvement
- I: total number of desired beams

**Lens Antenna Array Approach:**
- RF chain connected to lens antenna array
- New path division multiplexing paradigm
- Uses power splitter/mixer and switch
- Generates multiple beams via lens refraction
- Beam direction selection by antenna connection switching
- Significantly reduces beamforming complexity and hardware cost

#### 2) Flexible Beam Coverage

**Problem:**
- Conventional analog beamforming generates narrow beams to specific directions
- Some scenarios require wider beams or arbitrary-shaped coverage
- Target region may have random shapes and sizes

**Solution Requirements:**
- Wide beam covering large angular range
- Adaptive beam width adjustment per target area
- Flexible beam covering arbitrary shapes

**Wide Beam Implementation:**

*Sub-Array Scheme:*
- Large array divided into virtual sub-arrays
- Multiple sub-arrays generate beams
- Beams steered to evenly-spaced angles within beam coverage
- Multiple wide beams combination expands coverage range

*Optimization Scheme:*
- Alternating optimization algorithm (e.g., broadcast control signal coverage)
- Constraints:
  - Coverage probability for each user ≥ pre-determined threshold
  - Transmit power minimized

**Flexible Coverage (Arbitrary Shapes):**
- 3D beamforming with uniform plane array (UPA)
- Used for UAV-enabled mmWave communications

*Implementation Steps:*
1. Transform target area position coordinates to special-angle coordinates
2. Use wide beams to cover minimum rectangular envelope in angle domain
3. Design phase rotation for sub-arrays to reduce fluctuation
4. Beamforming gain concentrated in target coverage area

#### 3) Robust Beamforming

**Challenge:**
Many existing works assume:
- Known user positions
- Perfect CSI at base stations

**Reality:**
- Difficult to obtain accurate user position (mobility, GPS error)
- Complex propagation environment
- Finite pilot signal length
- Limited feedback bandwidth
- Training overhead grows with BS antenna size

**CSI Error Models:**

**Bounded CSI Error Model:**
- Estimation error confined within specific range
- Norm of channel estimation errors bounded by threshold

**Optimization Problem (Maximize Achievable Rate with CSI Errors):**
$$\max_{f,w} \min_\Delta \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{|w^H(\tilde{H} + \Delta)f|^2 P}{\sigma^2}\right)$$

**Subject to Constraints:**
$$|[w]_n| = 1/\sqrt{N_r}, \quad n = 1, 2, ..., N_r$$
$$|[f]_n| = 1/\sqrt{N_t}, \quad n = 1, 2, ..., N_t$$
$$\|\Delta\|^2 \leq \epsilon$$

where:
- H̃: imperfect CSI estimate
- Δ: CSI error
- σ²: white Gaussian noise power
- ε: CSI error bound
- Approach: Convert to convex sub-problems solvable by convex optimization

**Probabilistic CSI Error Model:**
- Channel estimation errors statistically independent from estimated matrix
- Characterized by matrix-variate complex circular Gaussian distribution
- Solution: Penalty dual decomposition based algorithm
- Jointly optimize digital and analog beamforming
- Maximize worst-case sum rate

### B. Multi-Antenna Multiple Access

**Overview:**
Traditional multiple access: TDMA, FDMA, CDMA

**Multi-antenna System Advantages:**
- Access to spatial domain via antenna arrays
- High antenna gain by beam direction control
- Data rate increase via simultaneous independent information transmission
- Reliability improvement via redundant signal transmission

**Three Advanced Multiple Access Technologies:**

#### 1) SDMA (Space-Division Multiple Access)

**Definition:**
Also known as Beam Division Multiple Access (BDMA)

**Mechanism:**
- Uses linear precoders/beamformers at transmitter
- Separates users in spatial domain
- Effective capacity increase
- Quality improvement

**Architecture:**
- BS generates different beams
- Allocates beams to different user positions
- Users covered by different beams transmit in parallel
- Same time-frequency resource block

**Digital Array Example (Downlink Two-User):**
- BS with Nt-element digital array
- Serves two single-antenna users
- Signal vector: s = [s₁, s₂]^T
- Beamforming vectors: f₁, f₂ ∈ ℂ^(Nt×1)

**Transmitted Signal:**
$$x = Fs = f_1 s_1 + f_2 s_2$$

where F ≜ [f₁, f₂]

**Received Signal at User k:**
$$y_k = h^H_k x + n_k, \quad k = 1, 2$$

where:
- hk ∈ ℂ^(Nt×1): channel response vector
- nk: Gaussian white noise, power σ²k

**User Decoding:**
- Each user k decodes only desired signal sk
- Treats interference as noise

**Achievable Rate of User k:**
$$r_k = \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{|h^H_k f_k|^2}{|h^H_k f_j|^2 + \sigma^2_k}\right), \quad (k,j) \in \{(1,2), (2,1)\}$$

**Precoder Designs:**
- Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF)
- Regularized ZFBF
- Optimized precoders

**Applications:**
- 4G and 5G multi-user MIMO
- Massive MIMO
- Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP)

**Key Challenge:**
- If user count > RF chain count: Inter-beam interference unavoidable
- Solution: Proper user grouping method
- Group users by RF chain count
- Assign users with highly correlated channels to same group
- Treat inter-beam interference via cancellation

#### 2) NOMA (Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access)

**Principle:**
Different from OMA, multiple users access same time-frequency-code domain

**Distinction Method:**
- Power domain differentiation
- Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at receiver

**Power Allocation Strategy:**
- Superimpose signals in resource block
- Higher power to user with lower channel gain
- Receiver uses SIC for successive decoding

**Two-User Example:**

*Downlink Scenario:*
- Superposition coding (different from SDMA)
- One user decodes interfering signal before desired signal

*Decoding Orders:*
- **Decode s₁ first:** User 1 directly decodes s₁, treating s₂ as noise
- **Decode s₂ first:** User 2 first decodes s₁, subtracts, then decodes s₂ without s₁ interference

**Achievable Rates:**
$$r_1 = \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{|h^H_1 f_1|^2}{|h^H_1 f_2|^2 + \sigma^2_1}\right)$$
$$r_2 = \log_2 \left(1 + |h^H_2 f_2|^2/\sigma^2_2\right)$$

**Decoding Order Rules:**
- Downlink: Users with worse channel gain decoded first
- Uplink: Users with higher channel gain and lower data rate decoded first

**Performance Advantages (mmWave):**
- High frequency signals have larger channel differences
- NOMA achieves higher achievable-rate gains vs. OMA
- Directional propagation allows users in same beam to leverage array gain
- NOMA + SDMA achieves better performance than SDMA + OMA

**Performance Metrics Comparison:**
- Spectral efficiency improvements
- Sum-rate gains
- Increased served user count

#### 3) RSMA (Rate-Splitting Multiple Access)

**Mechanism:**
- Linear precoded rate-splitting at transmitter
- SIC at receivers

**Key Difference from SDMA/NOMA:**
- Messages split into common and private parts
- Part of each user's message decoded by all users

**Two-User Example:**

*Message Splitting:*
- Common parts of both users → encoded into common stream sc
- Private parts → independently encoded into streams s₁, s₂
- Three streams created: sc, s₁, s₂

*Transmit Signal:*
$$x = F s = f_c s_c + f_1 s_1 + f_2 s_2$$

where:
- fc: common stream precoder (multicast manner)
- fk: private stream precoders (legacy multiuser-precoders like ZFBF)

*Received Signal at User k:*
