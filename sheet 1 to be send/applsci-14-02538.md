As mesh density increases from Scheme 1 to Scheme 2, the lateral force coefficient decreases from 2.8×10⁻² to 8.0×10⁻⁴ (approaching zero), confirming convergence. The drag coefficient increases from 0.690 to 0.716 (3.8% change), then stabilizes at 0.722 (only 0.8% change from Scheme 2 to 3). This demonstrates that Mesh Scheme 2 provides accurate results with acceptable computational efficiency, validating the selection of 4.34 million elements as the standard mesh density.

| Wind tunnel test | 0.8289 | 0.8565 | 0.7481 |

**Validation Analysis:**
Excellent agreement between CFD simulations and wind tunnel experimental results validates the numerical methodology:
- At 0° wind direction: 0.8241 (CFD) vs. 0.8289 (experimental) = 0.58% difference
- At 30° wind direction: 0.8254 (CFD) vs. 0.8565 (experimental) = 3.76% difference (maximum deviation)
- At 60° wind direction: 0.7729 (CFD) vs. 0.7481 (experimental) = 3.31% difference

The consistent trends across all wind directions and maximum difference of 3.76% demonstrate that the numerical simulation approach provides accurate representations of aerodynamic behavior.

- Non-uniform 2, 4, 5-antenna arrangements: ±30-50% variation across wind directions
- Form 3 (uniform): Minimal sensitivity, gentle curves
- Form 1 (asymmetric): Maximum sensitivity, sawtooth patterns

*Structural Design Implication:* Uniform arrangements provide more predictable wind loading, simplifying design calculations and reducing uncertainty factors.

---

**Finding 2: Lateral Components More Sensitive Than Drag Components**

*Quantitative Evidence:*
- Drag coefficient (CD) range: ≈5-10% across wind directions
- Lateral force coefficient (CS): ±100-200% variation across wind directions
- Windward moment (CMD): ≈3-8% variation
- Crosswind moment (CMS): ±50-100% variation

*Structural Design Implication:* Directional wind analysis essential despite small absolute values of lateral components; their high sensitivity to wind direction cannot be ignored.

---

**Finding 3: Antenna Arrangement Number Effects Are Modest**

*Quantitative Relationships:*
- Overturning force coefficient (CF): Approximately linear increase with number
- Overturning moment coefficient (CM): Increases at ~2× rate of CF
- Growth rates: Diminish with additional antennas
- Maximum sensitivity: 2-3 antennas; modest increments beyond 4 antennas

*Practical Implication:* Adding antennas beyond 6 per layer provides diminishing wind load increases; design effort justified up to 6 antennas.

---

**Finding 4: Antenna Arrangement Layers Have Significant Impact**

*Quantitative Evidence:*
- CF increase rate with layers: 7-22% per additional layer
- CM increase rate with layers: 8-41% per additional layer

---

### Engineering Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: Prioritize Antenna Number Over Layers**

*Strategy:*
1. Maximize antenna arrangement number per layer (target: 6 antennas)
2. Minimize antenna arrangement layers (target: 1 layer if feasible)
3. Example preference order:
   - **Most preferred:** 6 antennas on 1 layer
   - **Preferred:** 6 antennas on 2 layers (if coverage requires)
   - **Acceptable:** 4 antennas on 2 layers
   - **Avoid:** 2 antennas on 3 layers

*Quantitative Benefit:*
- Compared to equivalent-count multi-layer: 20-40% wind load reduction
- Foundation sizing: Proportionally reduced concrete volume
- Material costs: Significant savings from reduced base load requirements

---

**Recommendation 2: Select Uniform Antenna Arrangements**

*Antenna Count Guidance:*
- **Optimal:** 3, 4, 6 antennas (uniform symmetry available)
- **Acceptable:** 2, 5 antennas (non-uniform; requires directional analysis)
- **Avoid:** 1 antenna (asymmetric, extreme wind sensitivity)

*Design Advantage:*
- Uniform arrangements: Same wind loads across multiple wind directions
- Design simplification: Single design case often sufficient
- Safety margin: Better coverage of unknown wind scenarios

*Example - 6-Antenna Configuration:*
- 60° angular spacing (0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°)
- 6-fold rotational symmetry
- Identical aerodynamic response at any wind direction
- Minimal variation: <3% across all wind directions

---

**Recommendation 3: Wind Direction Consideration Strategy**

*For Uniform Arrangements:*
- Representative wind direction analysis sufficient
- Design case: Any single critical direction (usually 0° or 90°)
- Safety factors: Standard code values appropriate

*For Non-Uniform Arrangements:*
- Full wind direction sweep required (0°-180° minimum)
- Design case: Maximum coefficient across all directions
- Safety factors: Potentially higher given directional variation

*Multi-Directional Design Process:*
1. Evaluate all seven wind directions (0°-180° at 30° increments)
2. Identify wind direction with maximum CF and CM
3. Apply directional wind speed reduction factors (per code)
4. Design for critical combination of wind direction and speed

---

**Recommendation 4: Structural Safety Emphasis on Overturning Moments**

*Design Prioritization:*
1. **Critical:** Overturning moment coefficient (CM)
2. **Important:** Overturning force coefficient (CF)
3. **Secondary:** Individual components (CD, CS)

*Quantitative Emphasis:*
- CM growth rate ≈ 2× CF growth rate with antenna number
- CM growth rate ≈ 2-3× CF growth rate with layers
- Base moment dominates foundation design

*Foundation Design Approach:*
1. Calculate design moment: $M_{design} = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 D H^2 × C_M × γ_f$
2. Size foundation/anchor bolts for moment resistance
3. Verify tension/compression in connection elements
4. Check bearing capacity under moment-induced asymmetric loading

- Identify arrangement layers: N_layers
- Calculate antennas per layer: N_per_layer = N_total / N_layers
- Determine arrangement form (uniform vs. non-uniform)
- Note critical wind direction from code or analysis

**Step 2: Obtain Aerodynamic Coefficients**
- From current study (CFD results):
  - Match antenna configuration to study cases (1-18 total antennas)
  - Extract CF and CM for all wind directions
  - Select maximum values or critical combination
- Or use empirical correlations if outside study scope
- Apply dynamic amplification factors if unsteady flow expected

**Step 3: Calculate Design Wind Forces and Moments**
- Drag force: $F_D = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 A × C_D$
- Lateral force: $F_S = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 A × C_S$
- Overturning force: $F_{total} = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 A × C_F$
- Overturning moment: $M = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 D H^2 × C_M$

Where:
- ρ = air density (1.225 kg/m³)
- U₁₀ = reference wind speed (m/s)
- A = windward surface area (m²)
- D = average tower diameter (m)
- H = tower height (m)

**Step 4: Apply Load Combinations and Safety Factors**
- Per China's GB50009-2012 or equivalent code
- Typical load factors:
  - Normal wind: γ = 1.0-1.2
  - Extreme wind: γ = 1.4-1.6
- Combined loading: $F_{design} = γ × (F_{base} + F_{antenna})$

**Step 5: Verify Structural Capacity**
- Base shear check: Compare design force to tower capacity
- Moment capacity: Verify foundation/anchor bolt design
- Connection stress: Check welds and fasteners
- Displacement check: Estimate tower deflection (dynamic analysis if needed)
- Safety verification: Ensure safety factors exceed minimum requirements

3.2. Impact of Antenna Arrangement Number and Arrangement Form on the Wind Load of
Telecommunication Towers
When only one layer of telecommunication antennas is arranged on the tower, it is
possible to have one to six antennas in this single layer. When arranging one, three, five, or
six antennas, there is only one arrangement form. However, when arranging two or four
antennas, there are multiple arrangement forms.
When arranging two antennas, there are three forms, as shown in Figure 8. The wind

## Simulation Results and Performance Metrics

```text
er’s overturning moment
coefficient is about twice that of the overturning force coefficient. The tower’s overturning force
coefficient increases approximately linearly with the increase in antenna arrangement layers, while
the tower’s overturning moment coefficient exhibits a nonlinear increase with the increase in antenna
arrangement layers. The rate of increase in the wind load with the antenna arrangement layers is
significantly greater than that with the antenna arrangement number. Thus, to reduce wind load, it
is advisable in practical engineering applications to increase the antenna arrangement number per
layer, thereby reducing the antenna arrangement layers. The study also summarized a calculation
method for the structural wind load of telecommunication towers, taking into account the influence
of antenna arrangement parameters, providing a reliable basis for the structural design and safety
assessment of telecommunication towers in practical engineering.

For both the bare tower condition without antennas and the condition with a single layer

of elements were divided for each condition, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, which present the
calculated average drag coefficient and lateral force coefficient for the telecommunication
tower. With the increase in the number of elements, the average lateral force coefficient
of the tower is very small, approximately zero; the drag coefficient gradually increases.

The SST k-ω turbulence model was selected for its wide applicability, high accuracy, and

and the complex flow structures around the telecommunication tower were monitored
in real time. These elements collectively served as the standards for determining the
convergence of the computations.
In this study, these computations were used to solve the incompressible Reynolds-

r cylinder shapes used in the
referenced literature and in this study are quite similar, and the corresponding antenna
arrangement forms are essentially the same. Differences in details have a minor impact
on the overall wind load. Hence, the aerodynamic coefficients obtained in the referenced
literature and in this study are expected to be close. Table 3 presents the comparison of
the drag coefficients of the telecommunication tower obtained from wind tunnel tests and
numerical simulations when a single layer of three antennas is used. It can be seen that the
values of the drag coefficients obtained by both methods are very close, and their variation
trends with the wind direction are also consistent. This not only proves the accuracy of the
numerical simulation method used in this study but also enhances the credibility of the
research findings.

## Technical Specifications of Each Antenna or Relevant Component

```text
The subject of the study was an actual single-pipe telecommunication tower, with
a height of H = 35.0 m. The diameter of the circumscribed circle at the top is D1 = 0.5 m,
and at the bottom is D2 = 1.0 m. Through surveying, it was found that the tower can
accommodate up to three layers of telecommunication antennas, with each layer exhibiting
the same antenna arrangement number and antenna arrangement form, up to a maximum
of six per layer. Therefore, the total antenna arrangement number on the tower can range
from 1 to 18. The top surface elevation of the first layer of antennas is at 1.0H, the second at
0.85H, and the third at 0.71H. Figure 1 shows the mesh of the telecommunication tower
and the schematic of the wind loads when 18 antennas are arranged [31].

### 7.2 Engineering Recommendations

**For Wind Load Minimization:**

1. **Prioritize Antenna Number Over Layers:**

   - Four or six antennas provide excellent balance of coverage and uniformity

3. **Wind Direction Considerations:**
   - Designs using uniform antenna arrangements more robust to varying wind directions
   - Asymmetric arrangements require directional wind analysis
   - Consider representative worst-case wind directions (typically 0°, 90°, 180°)

4. **Structural Safety Implications:**
   - Overturning moment coefficients more critical than force coefficients for design
   - Moment increases at 2× rate of force with additional antennas
   - Foundation and base stress design should emphasize moment calculations
   - Layer reduction strategy particularly effective for moment reduction
