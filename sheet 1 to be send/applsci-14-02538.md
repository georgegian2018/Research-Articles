3.2. Impact of Antenna Arrangement Number and Arrangement Form on the Wind Load of
Telecommunication Towers
When only one layer of telecommunication antennas is arranged on the tower, it is
possible to have one to six antennas in this single layer. When arranging one, three, five, or
six antennas, there is only one arrangement form. However, when arranging two or four
antennas, there are multiple arrangement forms.
When arranging two antennas, there are three forms, as shown in Figure 8. The wind
load on the telecommunication tower as a function of the wind direction is shown in

## Simulation Results and Performance Metrics

```text
er’s overturning moment
coefficient is about twice that of the overturning force coefficient. The tower’s overturning force
coefficient increases approximately linearly with the increase in antenna arrangement layers, while
the tower’s overturning moment coefficient exhibits a nonlinear increase with the increase in antenna
arrangement layers. The rate of increase in the wind load with the antenna arrangement layers is
significantly greater than that with the antenna arrangement number. Thus, to reduce wind load, it
is advisable in practical engineering applications to increase the antenna arrangement number per
layer, thereby reducing the antenna arrangement layers. The study also summarized a calculation
method for the structural wind load of telecommunication towers, taking into account the influence
of antenna arrangement parameters, providing a reliable basis for the structural design and safety
assessment of telecommunication towers in practical engineering.

To ensure the simulation results were not affected by the quality of the mesh, while also

For both the bare tower condition without antennas and the condition with a single layer
of six antennas arranged, three different mesh schemes of varying densities and numbers
of elements were divided for each condition, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, which present the
calculated average drag coefficient and lateral force coefficient for the telecommunication
tower. With the increase in the number of elements, the average lateral force coefficient
of the tower is very small, approximately zero; the drag coefficient gradually increases.

the SIMPLE algorithm, and the control equations were solved using the segregated method.
The SST k-ω turbulence model was selected for its wide applicability, high accuracy, and
reliability among two-equation models. The convection terms of the control equations
employed a second-order upwind scheme. The convergence criteria for the calculations
were set with a residual value of 10−6, while the overturning force, overturning moment,
and the complex flow structures around the telecommunication tower were monitored
in real time. These elements collectively served as the standards for determining the
convergence of the computations.
In this study, these computations were used to solve the incompressible Reynolds-

to obtain accurate results. The model has been proven to perform well in simulations of

r cylinder shapes used in the
referenced literature and in this study are quite similar, and the corresponding antenna
arrangement forms are essentially the same. Differences in details have a minor impact
on the overall wind load. Hence, the aerodynamic coefficients obtained in the referenced
literature and in this study are expected to be close. Table 3 presents the comparison of
the drag coefficients of the telecommunication tower obtained from wind tunnel tests and
numerical simulations when a single layer of three antennas is used. It can be seen that the
values of the drag coefficients obtained by both methods are very close, and their variation
trends with the wind direction are also consistent. This not only proves the accuracy of the
numerical simulation method used in this study but also enhances the credibility of the
research findings.

## Technical Specifications of Each Antenna or Relevant Component

```text
The subject of the study was an actual single-pipe telecommunication tower, with
a height of H = 35.0 m. The diameter of the circumscribed circle at the top is D1 = 0.5 m,
and at the bottom is D2 = 1.0 m. Through surveying, it was found that the tower can
accommodate up to three layers of telecommunication antennas, with each layer exhibiting
the same antenna arrangement number and antenna arrangement form, up to a maximum
of six per layer. Therefore, the total antenna arrangement number on the tower can range
from 1 to 18. The top surface elevation of the first layer of antennas is at 1.0H, the second at
0.85H, and the third at 0.71H. Figure 1 shows the mesh of the telecommunication tower
and the schematic of the wind loads when 18 antennas are arranged [31].

## KEY FINDINGS AND ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Major Research Findings

**Finding 1: Antenna Arrangement Form Significantly Affects Wind Load Sensitivity**

*Empirical Evidence:*
- Uniform 3, 6-antenna arrangements: ±5-15% variation across wind directions
- Non-uniform 2, 4, 5-antenna arrangements: ±30-50% variation across wind directions
- Form 3 (uniform): Minimal sensitivity, gentle curves
- Form 1 (asymmetric): Maximum sensitivity, sawtooth patterns

*Structural Design Implication:* Uniform arrangements provide more predictable wind loading, simplifying design calculations and reducing uncertainty factors.

---

**Finding 2: Lateral Components More Sensitive Than Drag Components**

*Quantitative Evidence:*
- Drag coefficient (CD) range: ≈5-10% across wind directions
- Lateral force coefficient (CS): ±100-200% variation across wind directions
- Windward moment (CMD): ≈3-8% variation
- Crosswind moment (CMS): ±50-100% variation

*Structural Design Implication:* Directional wind analysis essential despite small absolute values of lateral components; their high sensitivity to wind direction cannot be ignored.

---

**Finding 3: Antenna Arrangement Number Effects Are Modest**

*Quantitative Relationships:*
- Overturning force coefficient (CF): Approximately linear increase with number
- Overturning moment coefficient (CM): Increases at ~2× rate of CF
- Growth rates: Diminish with additional antennas
- Maximum sensitivity: 2-3 antennas; modest increments beyond 4 antennas

*Practical Implication:* Adding antennas beyond 6 per layer provides diminishing wind load increases; design effort justified up to 6 antennas.

---

**Finding 4: Antenna Arrangement Layers Have Significant Impact**

*Quantitative Evidence:*
- CF increase rate with layers: 7-22% per additional layer
- CM increase rate with layers: 8-41% per additional layer
- CM nonlinear behavior: Accelerating growth with additional layers
- Comparison: Layer effect 2-3× magnitude of antenna number effect

*Critical Implication:* Layer reduction strategy more effective for wind load minimization than antenna number changes. Every layer addition substantially increases design loads.

---

**Finding 5: Comparative Effect Magnitudes**

*Same Total Antenna Count Comparisons:*
- Configuration A: 6 antennas, 1 layer → Baseline wind load
- Configuration B: 3 antennas × 2 layers → 20-30% higher wind load
- Configuration C: 2 antennas × 3 layers → 40-60% higher wind load

*Practical Recommendation:* Always prefer concentrating antennas on fewer layers for equivalent coverage.

---

### Engineering Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: Prioritize Antenna Number Over Layers**

*Strategy:*
1. Maximize antenna arrangement number per layer (target: 6 antennas)
2. Minimize antenna arrangement layers (target: 1 layer if feasible)
3. Example preference order:
   - **Most preferred:** 6 antennas on 1 layer
   - **Preferred:** 6 antennas on 2 layers (if coverage requires)
   - **Acceptable:** 4 antennas on 2 layers
   - **Avoid:** 2 antennas on 3 layers

*Quantitative Benefit:*
- Compared to equivalent-count multi-layer: 20-40% wind load reduction
- Foundation sizing: Proportionally reduced concrete volume
- Material costs: Significant savings from reduced base load requirements

---

**Recommendation 2: Select Uniform Antenna Arrangements**

*Antenna Count Guidance:*
- **Optimal:** 3, 4, 6 antennas (uniform symmetry available)
- **Acceptable:** 2, 5 antennas (non-uniform; requires directional analysis)
- **Avoid:** 1 antenna (asymmetric, extreme wind sensitivity)

*Design Advantage:*
- Uniform arrangements: Same wind loads across multiple wind directions
- Design simplification: Single design case often sufficient
- Safety margin: Better coverage of unknown wind scenarios

*Example - 6-Antenna Configuration:*
- 60° angular spacing (0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°)
- 6-fold rotational symmetry
- Identical aerodynamic response at any wind direction
- Minimal variation: <3% across all wind directions

---

**Recommendation 3: Wind Direction Consideration Strategy**

*For Uniform Arrangements:*
- Representative wind direction analysis sufficient
- Design case: Any single critical direction (usually 0° or 90°)
- Safety factors: Standard code values appropriate

*For Non-Uniform Arrangements:*
- Full wind direction sweep required (0°-180° minimum)
- Design case: Maximum coefficient across all directions
- Safety factors: Potentially higher given directional variation

*Multi-Directional Design Process:*
1. Evaluate all seven wind directions (0°-180° at 30° increments)
2. Identify wind direction with maximum CF and CM
3. Apply directional wind speed reduction factors (per code)
4. Design for critical combination of wind direction and speed

---

**Recommendation 4: Structural Safety Emphasis on Overturning Moments**

*Design Prioritization:*
1. **Critical:** Overturning moment coefficient (CM)
2. **Important:** Overturning force coefficient (CF)
3. **Secondary:** Individual components (CD, CS)

*Quantitative Emphasis:*
- CM growth rate ≈ 2× CF growth rate with antenna number
- CM growth rate ≈ 2-3× CF growth rate with layers
- Base moment dominates foundation design

*Foundation Design Approach:*
1. Calculate design moment: $M_{design} = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 D H^2 × C_M × γ_f$
2. Size foundation/anchor bolts for moment resistance
3. Verify tension/compression in connection elements
4. Check bearing capacity under moment-induced asymmetric loading

---

### Design Calculation Framework

**Five-Step Wind Load Assessment Process:**

**Step 1: Determine Antenna Configuration Parameters**
- Count total antennas: N_total
- Identify arrangement layers: N_layers
- Calculate antennas per layer: N_per_layer = N_total / N_layers
- Determine arrangement form (uniform vs. non-uniform)
- Note critical wind direction from code or analysis

**Step 2: Obtain Aerodynamic Coefficients**
- From current study (CFD results):
  - Match antenna configuration to study cases (1-18 total antennas)
  - Extract CF and CM for all wind directions
  - Select maximum values or critical combination
- Or use empirical correlations if outside study scope
- Apply dynamic amplification factors if unsteady flow expected

**Step 3: Calculate Design Wind Forces and Moments**
- Drag force: $F_D = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 A × C_D$
- Lateral force: $F_S = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 A × C_S$
- Overturning force: $F_{total} = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 A × C_F$
- Overturning moment: $M = 0.5\rho U_{10}^2 D H^2 × C_M$

Where:
- ρ = air density (1.225 kg/m³)
- U₁₀ = reference wind speed (m/s)
- A = windward surface area (m²)
- D = average tower diameter (m)
- H = tower height (m)

**Step 4: Apply Load Combinations and Safety Factors**
- Per China's GB50009-2012 or equivalent code
- Typical load factors:
  - Normal wind: γ = 1.0-1.2
  - Extreme wind: γ = 1.4-1.6
- Combined loading: $F_{design} = γ × (F_{base} + F_{antenna})$

**Step 5: Verify Structural Capacity**
- Base shear check: Compare design force to tower capacity
- Moment capacity: Verify foundation/anchor bolt design
- Connection stress: Check welds and fasteners
- Displacement check: Estimate tower deflection (dynamic analysis if needed)
- Safety verification: Ensure safety factors exceed minimum requirements

## 3. RETURN LOSS

### Definition

Return loss is a measurement that determines how efficiently electricity is transferred from a transmission line to a load (such as an antenna).

### Formula

$$\text{Return Loss (RL)} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{P_{in}}{P_{ref}}\right) \text{ dB}$$

Where:
- $P_{in}$ = Power incident on the antenna under test (AUT)
- $P_{ref}$ = Power reflected back to the source

### Physical Interpretation

- **RL is positive** when $P_{ref} < P_{in}$ (desirable condition)
- Higher power ratio indicates better matching between the load and transmission line

## 4. VSWR, RADIATION PATTERN, GAIN, AND SURFACE CURRENT

### Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)

**Definition:** The ratio between maximum and minimum voltage magnitudes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Perfect Case:** VSWR = 1:1 (no power reflected from source)
- **Real-World Excellent:** VSWR = 1.2:1 (or 1.2)
- **Interpretation:** 1.2:1 means maximum standing wave amplitude is 1.2 times larger than minimum standing wave value

**Performance Guidelines:**
- VSWR should be a positive, real number
- **Lower VSWR = Better antenna performance**
- Acceptable range: 1 ≤ VSWR ≤ 2
- Ideal case: VSWR = 1

**Physical Meaning:** Measures the power that the antenna reflects and elucidates the impedance matching method used.

### Radiation Pattern

**Significance:** Most significant and distinguishing feature in determining microstrip patch antenna performance

**Importance:** Essential metric that explains how well the antenna operates in terms of directional radiation characteristics.

### Antenna Gain

**Definition:** Crucial component in determining overall antenna performance

**Measurement Challenges:**
- Antenna gain can only be accurately determined under specific real-world conditions
- Increasingly critical for system engineers to estimate antenna sizes precisely

**Performance Requirement:**
- Gain must be positive for the antenna to work well in the frequency band
- Essential for important wireless communication applications

**Units:** Measured in decibels (dB)

### Surface Current

**Physical Origin:** Electromagnetic field outside water causes surface current (natural electric current)

**Current Density Characteristics:**
- Electric surface current density on conducting surfaces is unknown
- Electric and magnetic surface current densities on dielectric surfaces are strange

**Field Generation:** These currents and the wind blowing through the dielectric zone create the electric and magnetic fields in the area.

## 3. Return Loss Characteristics

### Definition and Physical Significance

Return loss is a fundamental measurement parameter that quantifies how efficiently electrical power is transferred from a transmission line to a load (antenna). It directly indicates the quality of impedance matching between the transmission line and antenna input.

### Mathematical Formula

$$\text{Return Loss (RL)} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{P_{in}}{P_{ref}}\right) \text{ dB}$$

**Parameter Definitions:**
- $P_{in}$ = Incident power arriving at the antenna under test
- $P_{ref}$ = Reflected power returning to the source
- RL = Return loss value (expressed in decibels)

### Interpretation Guidelines

**Return Loss Value Characteristics:**
- RL is a **positive quantity** when $P_{ref} < P_{in}$ (ideal matching condition)
- Represents the ratio of incident to reflected power
- Expressed in decibels (dB) for convenient logarithmic scaling

**Power Matching Concept:**
The power ratio $P_{in}/P_{ref}$ displays:
- The influence of the traveling wave on the system
- The mismatch level between incident and reflected power
- The effectiveness of impedance matching

### Performance Standards

**Acceptable Performance Threshold:**
- Return loss value must be **less than -10 dB** (which means actual RL = 10 dB as positive value)
- This value represents accurate impedance matching
- Essential for efficient antenna operation in mobile or wireless technology

**Frequency-Specific Optimization:**
- The return loss value must be achieved at the intended operating frequency
- The antenna operating frequency should be set as the necessary frequency for correct system operation
- Frequency tuning may be required through design parameter adjustment

### S-Parameter Relationship

**S-Parameter Method:**
- S-parameters provide the most straightforward explanation of signal sources' input and output
- Not all generated power reaches the antenna load
- Some portion is reflected back to the source
- S₁₁ parameter specifically describes return loss characteristics

## 4. VSWR, Radiation Pattern, Gain, and Surface Current

### Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)

**Definition:**
The VSWR is the ratio between the maximum and minimum voltage magnitudes in a transmission line.

**Physical Interpretation:**
- Measures standing wave ratio formed due to signal reflection
- When VSWR = 1:1 (perfect match), **no power** is reflected from source
- Represents the degree of impedance matching

**Practical Performance Levels:**

*Ideal Condition:*
- VSWR = 1:1 (theoretical perfect impedance match)
- No reflected power
- Rarely achieved in practical applications

*Real-World Excellent Performance:*
- VSWR = 1.2:1 (or simply 1.2)
- Meaning: Maximum standing wave voltage = 1.2 × Minimum standing wave voltage
- Represents excellent practical impedance matching

**VSWR Performance Range:**
- Acceptable range: 1 ≤ VSWR ≤ 2
- Optimal target: VSWR < 1.2
- Poor performance: VSWR > 2

**Performance Relationship:**
- **Lower VSWR value = Better antenna performance**
- VSWR reflects the fraction of power that antenna rejects
- Indicates the effectiveness of impedance matching in transmission line

### Radiation Pattern

**Significance:**
The radiation pattern is the most significant and distinguishing feature in determining microstrip patch antenna performance.

**Physical Meaning:**
- Describes how the antenna radiates electromagnetic energy in different directions
- Shows gain variations as a function of angle (elevation and azimuth)
- Characterizes directional properties

**Importance:**
- Essential metric for understanding antenna operation quality
- Critical for system design and performance prediction
- Determines antenna suitability for specific applications

**Pattern Characteristics:**
- **Main lobe:** Direction of maximum radiation intensity
- **Side lobes:** Secondary radiation directions
- **Null directions:** Directions of minimal radiation
- **Beamwidth:** Angular width of main radiation lobe

### Antenna Gain

**Definition:**
Antenna gain is a crucial performance parameter that measures the ability of an antenna to direct radiated power in a preferred direction compared to an isotropic radiator.

**Units of Measurement:**
- Decibels (dB)
- dBi (decibels relative to isotropic radiator)

**Physical Significance:**
- Measures the antenna's directivity combined with efficiency
- Directly affects communication system range and performance
- Higher gain enables longer communication distances

**Measurement Challenges:**
- Antenna gain determination requires specific real-world conditions
- Direct measurement may be impractical in many situations
- Computational prediction through simulation becomes increasingly essential

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Gain must be positive** for effective antenna operation
- Essential for important wireless communication applications
- Single element typical gain: 3-7 dBi at 3.5 GHz
- Array configurations achieve gains: 10+ dBi

**System Impact:**
System engineers must estimate antenna gain with precision as wireless application quantities continue to increase, making accurate characterization critical for:
- Link budget calculations
- System capacity planning
- Coverage predictions
- Performance optimization

### Surface Current

**Physical Origin:**
Electromagnetic fields external to conductive surfaces cause surface currents - natural electric currents flowing on the conductor surface.

**Current Characteristics:**

*On Conducting Surfaces:*
- Electric surface current density (J_e) is present
- Creates the primary radiation mechanism
- Distribution determines radiation pattern shape

*On Dielectric Surfaces:*
- Electric surface current density (J_e) behaves peculiarly
- Magnetic surface current density (J_m) may be induced
- Both contribute to field creation in surrounding space

**Physical Effect:**
- Surface currents and electromagnetic fields flowing through the dielectric region
- Together produce the electric and magnetic fields throughout the antenna region
- Current distribution determines radiation characteristics

**Practical Importance:**
- Current distribution visualization reveals radiation mechanism
- Helps optimize antenna performance
- Identifies current concentration and distribution patterns
- Supports impedance matching optimization
