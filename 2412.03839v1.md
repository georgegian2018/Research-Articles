A. Structures An obvious design for a FA is liquid metal (LM) fiber [4], as depicted in Fig. 1(a). It is made by injecting liquid metal into elastic micro-channels or hollow fibers. LM fibers, made by molding silicone or commercially available hollow fibers, offer excellent mechanical elasticity and can withstand numerous strain cycles without degradation. The high conductivity of liquid metal minimizes resistive losses, thereby reducing energy consumption during signal transmission. This durable and lightweight design ensures long-term reliability in harsh environments while maintaining energy efficiency. Another design for a FA is to utilize conductive fluid inside a tube-like container, in which the fluid can be mobilized by a digitally controlled nano-pump [2, Section VI-B], as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The controller adjusts dynamically the antenna’s position (a.k.a. port), shape and size based on the channel condition in real time, ensuring best performance. This agility makes it ideal for dynamic environments, or rapidly changing network settings as typically faced at mobile devices, obtaining consistency and stability in link connections. Fig. 1(c) illustrates another examp

III. APPLICATIONS ASSISTED BY FAS With the reconfigurability FAS possesses, it is expected that FAS can find many applications in wireless networks. In this section, we discuss several obvious applications, as illustrated in Fig. 2, that FAS can contribute to massively. A. Simultaneous Wireless Information, and Power Transfer (SWIPT) SWIPT has been an attractive feature to support the growing number of battery-powered devices for wireless connections. The fact that SWIPT aims to deliver data and energy concurrently makes it a smart technique but it also puts strains on the SWIPT transmitter. If the transmitter relies on a FPA, then both communication and power transfer efficiencies will be degraded. In this case, replacing FPA by FAS can empower the SWIPT transmitter for more DoF to elevate the performance of both communication and power transfer [9]. This is especially important if the transmitter is a mobile device as the number of RF chains tends to be very small. Evidently, a SWIPT mobile receiver benefits as well if FAS is deployed. A FPA has no DoF to optimize the received signal for SWIPT but a FAS can reconfigure itself to receive the best signal for power transfer and anot

The BS is equipped with 4 FAs. The IR and ER are both equipped with a single FA. We assume that the energy harvesting efficiency is set to 0.5 (i.e., 50%). The minimum distance between two FAs is set to be D = λ/2 with λ = 1 m. All other parameters are the same as those used in [9]. In this case study, we adopt the field response-based channel model to capture the geometric relationships between the FAs. This modeling approach considers finite multipath propagation effects (3 channel paths were considered in the simulations) and the angles of signal departure and arrival among different antenna positions, allowing for the optimization of antenna positions to enhance communication performance. Explicitly, in [9], an iterative algorithm was proposed for jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of BS, the locations of receive FAs within IR and ER, and the locations of transmit FA within the BS for maximizing the communication rate at the IR, denoted by R. We compare this scheme (called ‘FAS’) to the following three benchmarks: 1) Transmit FA (TFA): The BS has M FAs, each of which is equipped with an independent RF chain, while the IR and ER are both equipped with a single FPA. 2) Receive FA (RFA): The BS

This case study considers a RIS-assisted downlink communication system comprising a BS with a single FPA, a RIS with M reflecting elements, and a mobile user (MU) equipped with a single FA. Also, the direct link between the BS and the MU is assumed to be broken by obstacles. The distance between the BS and RIS and that between the RIS and the MU are both set to 200 meters.

Results in Fig. 4 are provided for the outage probability against the number of ports, N, of FAS, where the value of M is set to 40 or 45. The noise power is σ2 n = 10−8 W, and the transmit power is PS = 0.1 W. Therefore, the average received SNR is E(PS|γk|2/σ2) = 10 dB and 11.0231 dB for M = 40 and M = 45, respectively. The target data rate is R = 3 bit/s/Hz. In the numerical results, several different channel models with different properties were used. The block correlation model in [11] is denoted by ‘CLT-BC’.

## Simulation results and performance metrics

### Case study A: FAS-SWIPT systems (page 7)

Consider a FAS-assisted SWIPT system, which contains a BS, an information receiver (IR), and an energy receiver -5 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Fig. 3: Pmax/σ2 I versus R. (ER). The BS is equipped with 4 FAs. The IR and ER are both equipped with a single FA. We assume that the energy harvesting efficiency is set to 0.5 (i.e., 50%). The minimum distance between two FAs is set to be D = λ/2 with λ = 1 m. All other parameters are the same as those used in [9]. In this case study, we adopt the field response-based channel model to capture the geometric relationships between the FAs. This modeling approach considers finite multipath propagation effects (3 channel paths were considered in the simulations) and the angles of signal departure and arrival among different antenna positions, allowing for the optimization of antenna positions to enhance communication performance. Explicitly, in [9], an iterative algorithm was proposed for jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of BS, the locations of receive FAs within IR and ER, and the locations of transmit FA within the BS for maximizing the communication rate at the IR, denoted by R. We compare this scheme (called ‘FAS’) to the following three benchmarks: 1) Transmit FA (TFA): The BS has M FAs, each of which is equipped with an independent RF chain, while the IR and ER are both equipped with a single FPA. 2) Receive FA (RFA): The BS has M FPAs, while the IR and ER are both equipped with a single FA each. 3) FPA: The BS is equipped with M FPAs, while the IR and ER are both equipped with a single FPA. Our interest is to analyze the effect of the transmit power to noise ratio, denoted by Pmax/σ2 I, with M = 4 as shown in Fig. 3. The results in this figure show that the communication rate for all the schemes increases with Pmax/σ2 I. This is expected as a high SNR should allow a high data rate to be achieved and increase harvested energy. Additionally, the ‘FAS’ scheme consistently outperforms the benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing the communication rate. The substantial improvements, particularly the 73.1% enhancement over the FPA scheme, highlight the superior gain provided by FAS in optimizing the system performance.

### Case study B: FAS-RIS systems (page 8)

Another direction is combining FAS and RIS systems. This case study considers a RIS-assisted downlink communication system comprising a BS with a single FPA, a RIS with M reflecting elements, and a mobile user (MU) equipped with a single FA. Also, the direct link between the BS and the MU is assumed to be broken by obstacles. The distance between the BS and RIS and that between the RIS and the MU are both set to 200 meters. The wireless channel is assumed to undergo rich scattering, hence following Rayleigh fading. Detailed setup of other system parameters is set according to [11]. Results in Fig. 4 are provided for the outage probability against the number of ports, N, of FAS, where the value of M is set to 40 or 45. The noise power is σ2 n = 10−8 W, and the transmit power is PS = 0.1 W. Therefore, the average received SNR is E(PS|γk|2/σ2) = 10 dB and 11.0231 dB for M = 40 and M = 45, respectively. The target data rate is R = 3 bit/s/Hz. In the numerical results, several different channel models with different properties were used. The block correlation model in [11] is denoted by ‘CLT-BC’. This model is known to have great accuracy and analytical tractability. In addition, we also have the constant correlation model, denoted by ‘Constant’. This model is preferred when simplicity is the priority but it tends to overestimate the performance. As observed, increasing the number of FAS ports N from 5 to 50 significantly reduces outage probabilities, emphasizing the critical role of FAS in enhancing communication performance. Similarly, increasing the number of RIS elements M from 40 to 45 provides additional improvements, highlighting the potential of RIS technology to enhance network reliability. These results demonstrate a synergistic relationship between FAS and RIS, which can be effectively leveraged to significantly improve the reliability and efficiency of wireless networks. VI.
